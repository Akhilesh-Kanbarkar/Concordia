62,google reviews,"Chem. de la Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal","It seems that they operate in the banking systems of 80's! They do NOT accept the credit card or debit card of any other banks in order to receive the loan payment. In fact the only way possible to pay your loan is by cash!!! They force you to open an account in order to do any payments, and if you do not want to do that , then they make you bring cash to them. We live in a developed country and in a times when anything can be done remotely and electronically, but Scotia Bank does not accept the others bank carts."

At least don’t do it with the Ms. Masoumeh(MASI) Almasi who leaves me a very very bad experience. I applied a credit card that has some limits with her. She told me to help me apply, but I have to open an account(a debit card) with her, otherwise she can’t do it, and I followed her without any offers or rewards. A few days later, she told me that my application wasn’t successful. Then I called the customer service if someone apply for credit card must open a debit card, they said no. To my surprise, she opened a saving account for me but not told and noticed me clearly when I applied. I cancelled the debit card very early, but I haven’t known I actually have a saving one. Until today, I want to apply for a debit card in order to get an offer, the representative tells me that I am not eligible because I have one account already. I hate Masoumeh(MASI) Almasi, she is a liar."

I did all of that and now, two months later, I'm told they found no errors. So I'm simply out 300$ because of a malfunction that was in no way my fault! Do not use the envelope-free deposits!!"

The service is deteriorating exponentially this year 2019. The customer service and the agents at the reception have nothing to say about you. The example that annoys me is the fact that they are unable to update my signature and when you let them know they react like robots programmed to recite a programmed message and your problem is not resolved. 2019 is the worst I have spent with you and rest assured, I will soon leave your bank and those around me are aware of what I am going through."

I had to pay this fee in cash (no debit or credit card) to settle the negative balance on my account. I take out a $20 bill and the attendant gives me $16.50 before realizing her mistake. During the entire operation, not a single “please” or “thank you”. The least it could do for a bank that charges fees to its customers would be to hire employees who know how to count and who don't take their customers for numbers. I give two stars because there was coffee and tea in the waiting area."

I went to make a payment for my American visa because I couldn't do it online, I took the form I needed and my cards from other banks to see how I could make the payment. As soon as I arrived, the cashier made the process and asked me for the payment and I gave her my card that did not correspond to Scotiabank, she proceeded to tell me that I cannot make the payment if I do not have money, when I tried to clarify things she interrupted me and told me that she needed money to make the payment (again) and that I needed to have an account with Scotiabank (I have it, it's just that it's new and I had no funds). I was trying to communicate with her and she wouldn't let me speak and express myself in order to find a solution, she didn't want to help me. I asked her if I could withdraw money from the ATM and give it to her in cash and her response was """"well, let's see if with those (foreign) bank accounts you can withdraw the cash”. At the end I was able to withdraw the money from the ATM and make the payment i needed. I recently arrived in Canada, and I chose Scotiabank to be my bank, with these actions I was a little worried about the attention, I would like you Scotiabank, to improve your customer service because there is a lot of misinformation and you are here to help, not to put someone down or treat that way.

After days of chasing her with no answer, I called customer service and discovered that the card wasn't even processed! When I came to the branch, she gracefully ignored me, to which a supervisor said that she'll call me back (ofc she didn't). She later fed me some BS reasons why nothing was processed, asked for more things to send and sign. That took another month of chasing her.

A more professional approach would be to 1) provide the customer with the business card of someone knowledgeable about the questioned matters, 2) if necessary, transparently explain why seeing the financial advisor is required, and 3) if it's not necessary, avoid pressuring the customer and instead, offer a polite recommendation.

I spoke to the manager after who seemed much more logically reasonable and able to deal with the public. I was told that the teller had previously dealt with a possible fraud situation, which I understand but hardly seemed like an excuse for rude and impatient behavior since it wasn't with me.

My mortgage was up for renewal. I had another new financial advisor. The last couple of times I’ve had to renew my mortgage, I seem to keep getting new advisors. I took time away from work to meet with the advisor. He was late, mumbled some apology and couldn’t even look me in the eye. When he looked at my profile, he said I was restricted with the few renewal options listed in his system. He left to go speak with his senior manager. I was left sitting there for quite some time waiting for him come back. He came back and said he thought there was a glitch in the system and said he needed to call the headquarters and quickly started to usher me out of his office. I said something about taking time out of my afternoon away from work to be there and he made some comment about doing the mortgage over the phone. The appointment was done. The next day he sends me an email that I was unfortunately restricted to the options in the system. No mention about a follow up discussion or explanation as to why I was limited to those options. I wasn’t happy. I called customer support to complain about my experience. She heard me out and then transferred to the bank manager of that branch. I called left a message that was over a week ago. He never called me back. I went to another branch and proceeded to transfer my mortgage from that branch to another closer to my home. I don’t care if I get a callback. I will never step foot in that branch again. Right now, I am not happy with Scotia Bank. If you are looking for a mortgage, try another bank.

My appointment would be on 17 November, from 13h to 14h, with Financial advisor Phat Hoang. On 17 November, I did not receive a call during this scheduled period; however, I had a missed call from the bank number at 11:30 am. Disappointingly, I called the branch to complain. The customer service agent, a gentleman, told me the advisor noted that he called but I did not pick up the phone. This is just customer-blaming for unprofessional work. The customer service agent apologized and offered to help me book another appointment with another financial advisor, Tanya. I already booked an appointment on 23 November with another branch, but I accepted the offer, thinking it would be nice to know about the product earlier. My second phone appointment would be the next day, 18 November at 2 pm. I asked if I received a confirmation email about it, he said yes; however, I did not receive that kind of email. On 18 November around 1 pm, I received a voicemail from Tanya saying she tried to call me but could not reach me and recommended me to go with the appointment on 23 November at the other branch instead. Wow...she must be busy dealing with bigger, richer customers. I called the branch again to ask about what happened. The customer service agent this time, although was a very nice lady, said that there was nothing else they could do but I had to go to the branch instead. I refused to do so, saying it was not my fault that I didn't receive the call. She promised to contact Tanya and ask her to call me back within the day. I haven't received such a call back.

Then sue for them back in court. The service is gone the bank is empty and the Manager was more like a timeshare salesman trying to lock me into a 3yr mortgage.

To waste my time, get hard enquiry on my credit score, my plans to buy things for my new place. I'm also going to start another company and ruin my schedule because of their laziness or care about their client and reputation. Om definitely pissed for they've don't that several times now.

I'm so very much disappointed.

They have requested repeatedly forms of documentation like drivers license, passport, personal and business documents etc. etc. Yet they continue to make ridiculous excuses to keep me away from my $5525. I think they are simply trying to make me give up so they can steal my funds. Scotiabank, I have retained all the email communications illustrating how crooked you are. Care to challenge me to release these publicly and humiliate your company further?"
1120,SiteJabber,NA,"Customer service consists of a mandatory conversation with a robot before being informed that wait times to speak to a human are ""greater that 45 minutes"".

Who in their right mind would continue to accept this kind of treatment?"
1121,SiteJabber,NA,"Don't choose this bank, I guess it will bankrupt.

Scotiabank's new campaign from Rethink - aptly titled Bad Advice - is a response to the onslaught of unsolicited advice that we find ourselves faced with today. Everything from relationship advice, to financial advice, to parenting advice.

A majority of Canadians find the financial world more confusing and complex than they did five years ago. And unsolicited, automated, and downright bad advice about money is a big cause of this confusion, with 54% of Canadians admitting to receiving bad financial advice at least once."

Anytime you try to call them it's impossible to get through and nobody is able to help you with your holds. Any branch I ever go to to deposit, the ATM machines never work. Overall, I have deep regret that I even open an account with them."
1123,SiteJabber,NA,"I've never been to a bank where no one knew anything about their own products and services. Don't take any financial advice from their brain dead advisors because they'll just screw you over. Do your own research.

Every advisor I spoke didn't know $#*!, gave $#*!ty advice, and just kept passing me onto the next person. Even the manager sounds like he hates his life and doesn't want to be there. I'm never banking with Scotiabank again. It's a sad excuse for a bank. They might as well hire AI to answer their calls. At least I'll actually get helpful information. Asking them questions is like pulling teeth. I have to ask the same question ten times for them to get it and then they tell me ten different answers and transfer me to at least three people. No one wants to take any responsibility and help customers out. They should all just quit."
1124,SiteJabber,NA,"Did an international money transfer from my bank 2 years ago. Money got bounced back from the receiving international bank but did not return to my account till date. I've made several trips to the branch and everyone I spoke to either appear clueless or are not interested to help at. Several rounds of telephone calls and emails and yet no way of tracking the money in their system. They are such a joke of a bank. If I had my way, I will pull out this minute."
1125,SiteJabber,NA,"Like what kind of logic is it to lock someone out of their online banking while they mail you a new card. Like the mail took 20 days for the card to arrive during which i had no access to my bank account...

Also everytime i phone i get the message ""We're experiencing higher than normal call volumes"". How is that possible 24/7 you may wonder? Well god damn i wish to know too, it's almost like they're $#*!ty design decisions result in more people calling in and not enough reps to take the calls.

Now they REQUIRE 2 step verification with a cell phone and I can no longer login to the bank without it. I am done and ma closing my account. NOT worth the headache. 0 stars if it would let me"
1132,SiteJabber,NA,"After spending 45 minutes waiting for customer service, to ask about why I cannot use my debit card on Gray, I was transferred to fraud… who apparently handle this kind of claim.
Spent another 30 minutes with no answer… could not take it any longer.
I really do not know how a bank that makes billions in profit cannot handle customer requests in a decent and timely way! A disaster!"
1133,SiteJabber,NA,"Anyone that you speak with are not a resident of Canada. Wait time now is ridiculous from 30 minutes or more. Never used to be that way 3 years ago. Fraud department putting accounts on hold when unnecessary. Just garbage service!
When they they are sorry, believe me, they're not. That word sorry should not belong in their vocabulary.."
1134,SiteJabber,NA,"Fraud has been committed on my debit account as of 8:32 Eastern time today!

I have ben on hold for over 35 minutes with NO call back option, $#*! $#*! elevator music and some idiot chiming in every other minute to let me know that a fraud analyst will be with me shortly!

My mortgage is due n in a year and I won't be renewing with Scotia Bank!"
1135,SiteJabber,NA,"They don't even deserve this 1 star rating.
I cannot login into my online banking account, message say card expired.
I called the *******842 # came after expired card message & there was an option, press some # if you don't have the card.
I didn't had my card, so picked the option, hold the line for 35 (THIRTY FIVE) minutes and this Monica lady telling me she couldn't help me without card#. I asked her to find or try another option to resolve my login problem, but she refused.
I am closing my accounts with this $#*!ty bank & will tell my clients to avoid this bank, go to other banks who know what the customer service is."
1136,SiteJabber,NA,"Scotiabank has completely lowered their standards. I have never seen such neglect in banking customer service before my experience with scotiabank. It is near impossible to reach customer service on the phone, they keep you waiting no Matter what time you call, be it early in the morning or, late at night. After holding for next to an hour, they cut you off. This has happened one too many times. I am done with this bank."
1137,SiteJabber,NA,"If 0 stars was an option, that's what I would choose. Try calling a branch to get an appointment to renew a mortgage. You'll wait on hold for hours, then get disconnected. Repeatedly. Apparently Scotia does not care about your business. I will obviously be moving my mortgage elsewhere."
1138,SiteJabber,NA,"A few years ago, I would five stars to this bank. Now, they are the worst. Their employees started to make mistake after mistake. When I try to reach Scotiabank by the phone, every time, it is a very long wait, both at my branch and at their central number. Very unprofessional, rude employees appeared. They started to ask too many personal questions, although the bank has my voice recognition. Yet, they have no idea what is happening with my account. Some employees who answer the phone cannot understand English, and it is a challenge to understand their accent. But their golden rule is: the customer is always wrong. They started lying, giving ridiculous excuses, insulting clients' intelligence. How can anyone trust such a bank?"
1139,SiteJabber,NA,"When ever you talk to these idiots if they do not like your answer the just hang up, get use to waiting online. Save yourself some frustration and go elsewhere. I called a second time and they transferred me to the fraud department and left on hold for more than 1 hour then I hung up."
1140,SiteJabber,NA,"Ever since Scotiabank switched from using envelopes to make deposits, it's been a nightmare. 95% of the time, the ATM spits out your cash because it won't take it. I have made between 10 to 20 complaints about this and the issue continues. Today, it spat out my cheque, it even damaging it (put a folding crease in it). I then had to go inside, wait in line to make my deposit, as I entered, I asked the women at the reception to let the manager know. She chose not to action my request, she then served someone else who came in a few minutes after me. I then asked again if she could advise the manager of the continued issues with their ATM, only then did she get up but not before ROLLING her eyes at me. The only good thing I have to say about this branch is that the tellers are great and always been."
1141,SiteJabber,NA,"There is a reason why this bank has over 90% bad reviews. This bank has gone down to the level of criminality. They do not serve customers any more, they only harm them and harass them. And each of their managers are trained just to do that. They harass and bully their customer and even can commit crime against them as did Ms. Melanie Lopes, Scotiabank manager in Toronto. She is an enemy to her customers, not a friend. Literally. She actually deliberately destroys her customers financial futures to satisfy her egos. Be aware of this lowest form of human excrement on this earth."
1142,SiteJabber,NA,"Although I've been with the bank for so many years, my concerns are treated just as if I am a teenager with a $500 account. It's like my business is not important. But if they're treating customer like they do, NEVER EVER going the extra mile, trying to help, or to please, why be in the business at all? Awful! And too bad that it's taken me so long to realize that! Take your business to a bank that will see you as a person, worker, mother! Not a number!"
1143,SiteJabber,NA,"I've been trying to reach scotiabank to get a new credit card to replace my broken one and their IP phone system is completely broken when using all EN, FR and credit center phone numbers. I can't interact with the phone form and employees can't hear me. My phone being the problem was ruled out by calling 2 friends successfully.

They don't have a chat system on their website or an email address I can reach, I can't ask for a new card through the app and they are asking me to call the credit center when going there in person. So I'm stuck with my broken card with no service, no support and no way to fix this. Will call tomorrow, but this is very inconvenient"
1144,SiteJabber,NA,"I would like to Thank Scotiabank for their great service, I was charged a $48 nsf fee today because one of my three payments that come out every month on the same day was less than $1.00 short so instead of keeping my account -$0.69 they charged me $48.00 and now I will be charged the same $48 today as they will try to retake this payment out but now I will be short $48.69. After being a customer for 20 years plus you would think you would have your customers best interest in consideration and not rob them for something as stupid as $0.69...nice pre Christmas gift Scotiabank"
1145,SiteJabber,NA,You wait so long to speak with a customer service rep. It's usually someone I can't understand. I have had to call 3 x now to get my credit card sent out to me. They always disconnect from you. They don't know what there doing. It really makes you wonder with almost $17 monthly charge just for my account not including anything they try to suck from you. You would think these incompetent people would at least have good customer service
1146,SiteJabber,NA,Does Scotia bank ever know how to treat their customers? How can you jack up someone's balance from 6000 dollars to ******* dollars. And I keep calling and customer service keeps ending the call on me. So rude
1147,SiteJabber,NA,"I have always paid bills and done transactions on my PC. I can only access my account on my phone because I downloaded the app. Two of my daughters are former employees. One daughter has been locked out of her accounts twice, she told me they have implemented AL. The other daughter they lost her identity and she could not access her Scotiabank pension. Both daughters say don't trust this bank, my concern is they would take my Old Age Pension as a profit for shareholders.

Vicki"
1148,SiteJabber,NA,"As I was charged twice on a purchase I call to get it cleared up. Waited to talk to someone just for them to transfer me then ending up just hanging up on me all together. I call back and it's an even more wait time then the first call. How does a person keep their cool when trying to talk to a bunch of idiots. 0 rating from me. From the looks of the other reviews, scotiabank should get their $#*! together. In the meantime I'll be closing my accounts while they try to figure out, doubt things will ever change with this bank though. Save yourself the hassles
And go somewhere else 100%"
1149,SiteJabber,NA,I called trying to change the way i paid for my overdraft as im doing an 80 hour unpaid placement for school and knew i would be in the overdraft a lot more. The guy ended up deleting it by accident and ive had to call 30 more times to get a case file set up and now its been a month and ive called a few times they've sent me back and forth to different people just to get annoyed that im checking in i am now looking into bmo $#*! this bank
1150,SiteJabber,NA,"We've been a Scotiabank customer for over 30 yrs. In fact, we've been loyal to one particular manager who we believed loyalty was reciprocal. Not so! Following an issue that was raised and explanation requested, we were ignored. Following several weeks of waiting and a few reminders for a reply, I addressed the situation with president's office/customer service. I received a reply within 30 days to my satisfaction.
Happy to move my file to another branch. I'd rate this branch a ‘1' following our years of loyal service. Obviously We meant nothing to this particular manager. I wonder if they've heard of ‘customer retention'? They made a lot of money off of us with our mortgages, interest. And yes, the odd penalty, Happy to move on from this branch to another. Bye!"
1151,SiteJabber,NA,"I've been a Scotiabank Scene Visa cardholder for years. Until recently, Scotiabank customer service used to be phenomenal, now it's one of the worst customer service providers, anywhere. It looks like Scotiabank opened up the customer service positions to whoever wants the job. The customer service agents are rude and unresponsive. I had an interaction with an agent who should have documented notes on the file. Next time I called to follow up on that problem the agent was not only incompetent but so rude, he should not be working in customer service. He took control, he told me there were no notes on file to reference and it was my problem, he didn't care; he definitely enjoyed the power trip. I could hear the disdain in his voice. Absolutely sick! There was no point calling again, I'd be on hold for hours and end up talking to another untrained, unprofessional. Shame on you Scotiabank!"
1152,SiteJabber,NA,"Friday afternoon, I am not able to access my bank account online. Banks closed. It's my birthday and fathers day tomorrow. Call customer service to tell me nothing they can do and they're sorry. Have to wait till Monday. I will be pulling my money out on Monday and switch banks. Screw you scotiabank. I have had enough. Time for change. I don't recommend this bank to anyone!"
1153,SiteJabber,NA,"I attended at the Mavis and Dundas Scotia Bank to cash a US cheque from my Scotia I trade account, something I have been doing regularly for the last 15 years. This branch is under new management (not a very good change) they refused cashing the check as not prepared to take the risk. This check was issued by the same institution so there is no risk.

I would strongly encourage everyone to stay away from this branch. Poor service and basically management is stupid"
1154,SiteJabber,NA,"It's been over two years on the phone and on line
Trying to get a credit card statement mailed or by email to me.
The only time the bank seems to be responsive or proactive is if the payment is late. Again I explained the fact that years ago I stopped getting any notifications. I'm told the card isn't linked to anything but no on seems to be able to do it.
The wait times are also ridiculously long for no reason."
1155,SiteJabber,NA,I have been told by the customer service agent for maintaining minimum balance in your account & I have been doing that since they are charging me monthly fee. I would never recommend to open account with Scotiabank.Worst banking experience.
1156,SiteJabber,NA,I have been trying to deal with the Fraud department for 6 weeks and have spent hours on hold or left multiple messages to get a call back. The assistant manager at my bank says Fraud is not his department and I must deal with that department. Not with him. At this point they are putting interest charges on the fraudulent money that was taken from my account. Yesterday I received a letter stating they have opened an account to look into the matter and gave a phone number to call. I have spent several hours on hold and left several messages for a call back with no response. If this is customer service I can't say a good thing about it.
1157,SiteJabber,NA,"I work for Scotiabank call center and trust me, the employees and the most nasty people, they $#*! and piss on the floors and they feel like they are a different breed of humans cause they work for the call center, another thing, these people are racist, imagine I was told that janitors are not to enter the kitchen or have lunch in the cafeteria but inside a closet where supplies are kept. Overall garbage people that feel they are better that everyone else."
1158,SiteJabber,NA,"2 of my Scotiabank credit cards were subject to a fraud, I called customer service and I was transferred to the Fraud Department. I have been on the phone for 2 hrs and nobody answers, It's clear that there is a manager at Scotiabank willing to save a few pennies instead of providing the customer with an efficient and friendly service. The communication system is the worst I ever faced, there is no chance to leave a message so somebody will call you back when available. This is extremely disappointing."
1159,SiteJabber,NA,The worst bank I ever had! The costume service never have answers to me questions … I have been more than 3 months without receiving any transaction from others banks. They told me that my account I was fine.and the others banks have problems. Sorry but four different banks can't be wrong. And I had another's inconvenient but I think I need 3 pages to tell you guy's.my advice DO NOT OPEN any account with them..
1160,SiteJabber,NA,"Good afternoon,
Today we encountered a discriminatory interaction with a customer service representative named Arif. She failed to offer us assistance because my grandmother does not speak English, but Spanish. In a rude manner she offered my grandma who we expressed is unable to physically go to the bank to resolve the issue with someone who could understand her. She then further told us that her first language is Spanish, which all within itself does not make any sense. If you are able to assist us in your own native language we shouldn't have faced an issue, we should have been able to pass through the authentication process. This is ridiculous and a representation of the further issue of the company not just it's incompetent and self discriminatory employees."
1161,SiteJabber,NA,"I had a few accounts with Scotiabank and somehow, either internally or externally a person was able to open two Mastercard and two Visa accounts under my name without my approval and I did not even do any online banking. This hacker was also able to take my identity and change my address, phone number and other banking information. Needless to say I closed both accounts with Scotiabank. You cannot trust a bank with such low online banking standards and security protocols."
1162,SiteJabber,NA,"After waiting on hold for 45 minutes, to report and discuss numerous phone calls received regarding fraudulent activity on my Visa card, I was told my account could not be authenticated. I apparently must go in person to a Scotiabank to authenticate myself. I have had a Visa card account with Scotiabank for 50 years, but not for much longer. Very disappointing customer service."
1163,SiteJabber,NA,"I've been with this bank for more than 30 years and every year the service has deteriorated. Basically no one wants to work. Incompetent managers!
I can understand how COVID affected the medical world but no excuse for very poor services on banks!"
1164,SiteJabber,NA,"This bank lost 2 of my US transfers, I called them daily no one ever answered the phone. I came in twice to speak to a manager who was always to busy to speak with me yet the bank is always empty. Promised to call me back, but never did. I forwarded my issues to the head office in Toronto where I was offered $300 meanwhile my $4000 US transfers still have not been found. I honestly can't believe a Canadian bank can be run so poorly and still be open."
1165,SiteJabber,NA,I need the statement for my car loan and I call them at different days and the agents told me they will send it to my email. Just wait for 24 to 48 hours but it's been 3 days now nit receive any yet to my email. I look at my junk mail not either there. They sent me me review or survey to answer and answer it diligently but nothing receive from them. Please be nice to the customer if you want a nice review. Thanks
1166,SiteJabber,NA,"Worst customer service I have ever received from a bank in Canada. I have multiple products with them like mortgage, Line of Credit (both secured and unsecured), credit card. But they behave weird; they took few weeks to send card, they set up multiple profiles for me on their own folly and advice me to setup appointments to resolve!, I need to wait for more than an hour to contact them just to reactivate the card and the person on the other end wont be of any help!

Just pissed of!"
1167,SiteJabber,NA,Just phoned Scotiabank *******842 to enquire about opening a Momentum Plus Savings Account 5.15% for 5 months and 2.40% Welcome Bonus. Automated service advised wait to speak with agent is approximately 15 minutes. They just lost my business. I see they only have a rating of 1.24* meaning the majority of customers are dissatisfied with their service. No wonder stock has tanked.
1168,SiteJabber,NA,I'm currently enjoying their banking experience. 2h on hold with three transfers from incompetent agents who don't possess the necessary information. Other banks (CIBC) offers a call back feature when they are experiencing high volumes. I was told by an employee that they don't do that at Scotia. Why don't they hire more phone tellers to speed up their process then?
1169,SiteJabber,NA,"I have banked with multiple financial institutions across the world, and in my experience Scotiabank is by far the worse. First red flag was when my credit card kept getting declined at payment terminals, Scotiabank chalked it up to a Chip problem and issued me a new card. However, this new card keeps getting declined now and then, leading to major embarrassment. On top of that; they have this ultra tight security system for online purchases that flags each and every big ticket purchase that one makes, so essentially the credit card is never charged, and you end up wasting your valuable time arguing with their customer care on the phone, which can take anywhere from 30 mins to more than an hour. Steer clear of ScotiaBank and their products; highly unreliable bank. I will be taking my money out of this disaster of a financial institution when I can make an alternate arrangment."
1170,SiteJabber,NA,"I had been banking with Scotiabank for over ten years and just recently I switched to a new bank.
More times than not, their app doesn't work. They have something called ""courtesy overdraft"" which is just robbery because they say they'll let a transaction go through to not charge you overdraft but then charge a $15 overdrawn handling fee on top of the monthly fee. I been noticing these charges for months now until I recently called in and their adviser was like it can't be removed over the phone, lmao. They're telling me I'm in the negative balance but that's not what I'm seeing through the mobile app. It makes no sense, how can I transfer and spend money that's not in the account in the first place. Their telephone service is never of any help. I'm pretty much fed up with Scotiabank's shenanigans."
1171,SiteJabber,NA,"What an absolute joke. I've had a debit card with scotiabank since I was a teenager and only recently got a credit card. Never had an issue until now. Got multiple calls and emails that my card ""MAY"" have been compromised. It wasn't I was the one who made the purchase. Annoying right? OK so ill just call the fraud department to get it sorted out quickly. WRONG! I've called 5 times each time I waited 2+ hours and no one answers. Today we have reached the 3.5 hour mark and I am beyond livid. I reached out via Twitter and Facebook but the replies are always "" we are sorry to hear that"" No do better. Beyond frustrating especially when I work 2 jobs i don't just have all day to do this. Stay away from this bank."
1172,SiteJabber,NA,"Majority of customer service agents I talked with was terrible, especially the one names Milton. He didn't even know about his bank products, did offer me $300 introductory bonus cash, which supposed to apply for new client only while I'm an existing client. Then couldn't solve my question but advised to email to the bank's president email. Also, let me wait for more than 45'. Awful. Couldn't understand how he could sit in the bank office."
1173,SiteJabber,NA,Honestly the worst place to do business or spend your money. They couldn't care less about your financial well being or needs as a client. The phone line is even more useless as you wait on hold for at least 30 min and need to be transferred to several people ( if you get that far as some don't know how to transfer without disconnecting the call) The fees are absolutely asinine. Just an entirely horrible experience and I advise anyone to please do your banking literally anywhere else if at all possible
1174,SiteJabber,NA,Opened a bank account for my 14 yr old. He forgot his online banking password and it wouldn't let him proceed even after following all the prompts. Called in. Waited 20 mins and then the representative after asking a ton of questions said we would have to physically go into the bank to change the password because are accounts are not linked and he is a minor. Hello! What kind of terrible process is that. Definitely considering switching banks.
1175,SiteJabber,NA,"Wish I could give a 0 rating as the customer interaction and trust level of long time customers is basically not existent. They have impeded the movement of funds, tried to increase my mortgage rate unless I complain and threaten to leave. Visa cut off due to a couple days late, but there is a 2k payment that they are stopping from being made, which should unfreeze the card. They need to learn how to deal with people, and not be solely targeting making money. Right! Will never happen

A bank has only one goal, make money any way they can. So sad

I will for sure be looking for a new banking alternative."
1176,SiteJabber,NA,"International students this is a warning! Avoid this bank at all cost. I did not have money in Canada because the bank returned a wire. They have horrible customer service even if you escalate to presidential level. You will be just a helpless victim since they take one million years to resolve an issue and respond. Their customer service hung up on you when you request for a manager, they can't speak English and have poor comprehension skills. You want an account, where you can withdraw your funds easily they turn it into GIC! That's not good service, and that's disclosing your products properly to consumers. Don't believe that they are Canada's number one bank, go with other banks. Horrible, horrible, bank, why do you even exist?"
1177,SiteJabber,NA,"This is the worst bank or institution of any type I have encountered ever. I am the executor trying to settle a family members estate, unfortunately they had multiple accounts all originating at one branch on Trafalgar road. Manager did not return calls or emails, poor advisor must be in the same boat as I as this poor younger person just cant do anything; would anyone believe they have at least 6 estate departments all with different phone no's and so far 4 departments tell me its not theirs and they are not able to help and they are not on the same system so documents uploaded are not shared. It is so bad that I now copy everyone that I have ever talked to on the emails.
There should be negative star ratings available for companies like this.
Stay away from this bank!"
1178,SiteJabber,NA,This bank has lost my trust and business. I needed to remove my ex-wife from two mortgages I have for my investment properties after a separation agreement has been signed. Scotiabank pretends to open a new mortgage for me (which is ok) but treat like I am virtually paying off the old mortgages and pay the penalties but keep the business with them. As reference I am doing the same with another bank (CIBC) and there is not such insane and illogical situation like with Scotiabank. This made me realize that Scotiabank goals is to take money from customers at any cost. Terrible bank I am moving my businesses (mortgages and credit cards) to another bank as soon as possible. Stay away from Scotiabank.
1179,SiteJabber,NA,"Worst bank ever... over 1.5 hours on hold to reach a representative! This is unexceptable, then to finally reach someone and she answers the phone with ""What can I do for you""? No hi how are you? Sorry for the delay nothing! She was incredibly rude, then the phone gets disconnected! Like Oh my God, my frustration level is raging! Definitely changing banks tomorrow. Never will I ever deposit another red cent to this bank. Can't even give a complaint because no one ever replies. Great service guys, keep up the good work"
1180,SiteJabber,NA,"I opened a chequing, savings account and a few credit products with my husband two years ago with Scotiabank. It has been nothing short of a nightmare to deal with them. The simplest task can not be completed correctly. They withdraw payments from your account without authorization. The misinformed staff are rude, and need attitude adjustments. Stay far away from the biggest crooks in the banking industry!"
1181,SiteJabber,NA,"Getting really F***** sick and tired of not being able to access my money while Scotia does ""routine maintenance"". I've had bank accounts my entire life and this garbage has started frequently happening over the last 6 months. WTF is Scotia really up to? I've had enough. Tomorrow I'm pulling my money and closing my accounts. I'm done with this incompetent f***** bank. Go to pay for gas and the transaction comes back declined when I have money but can't access it bc Scotia is screwing around once again. Im done! I'd give zero star if I could. A bank has one job. To hold my money til I need it. They can't even do that right."
1182,SiteJabber,NA,Stay far away from these clowns. They will kiss your butt for your business but won't maintain the ones they already have. Total incompetent. See for yourself. Try and get ahold of anyone there. Horrible
1183,SiteJabber,NA,"I recently paid off my Scotia Mastercard in full.
Back story, the pandemic was hard! As a small business owner, I really had to rely on my personal credit to get by, my card expired last month and after paying it in full I called to get a new card. My request was denied, my card cancelled and the scotia rep literally said ""scotia is not in the business of helping people""

I'm going to close my accounts."
1184,SiteJabber,NA,"If it's a Friday and you're expecting money to come in,you have to wait until Monday! Why? All other banks will have it to you first thing Saturday morning.
And charges. Everything has a freaking bank charge."
1185,SiteJabber,NA,It took Scotiabank 9 weeks to transfer my mutual fund RRSP to another bank which resulted in me losing money by the day. They took absolutely no responsibility for dropping the ball. Stay away from Scotiabank and its entities if you want to keep your money. Terrible customer service!
1186,SiteJabber,NA,"I bank with a number of banking institutions personally and professionally, and Scotiabank is by far the worst of all my banking experiences. First, the online site is horrible. There seems to always be a problem with the site. Second, when you try to contact someone, either the call is busy, or you receive ad recording after ad recording attempting to sell you services you did not seek, and then the call often drops when you have gotten through all the ads. I have written and emailed the bank for months about an important issue and have never received any response. On the few occasions where I have gotten someone on the phone, they have said to do the very same thing I've already done over again (sending an email) but I still do not ever get a response much less a resolution to the issue. I have tried contacting Scotia about the issue at every number it has, but still no resolution. Just a horrible banking experience!"
1187,SiteJabber,NA,"The online system is a complete catastrophe. In spite of always using correct user name and password the system keeps on kicking me out from access to its services. Thus, i cannot take care of my bank errands from abroad. I have tried every possible way to contact them - different call and help centres, Twitter, my local bank accountant, the superior managers - but nobody can help me. It is a disaster. This means that i cannot access my money and it is basically theft.
In today's society a bank cannot operate with a dysfunctional online ""service"". It is completely unacceptable. I couldn't be more dissatisfied."
1188,SiteJabber,NA,"I opened this account when I was 19. I'm canadian, but my father was stationed overseas. I've had nothing but problems since I opened with them. Over and over and over. Fees that I dont understand, clerks that cant explain them, rude workers, decisions that make no sense. They have nerve charging what they charge. Even friends and family camt believe some of my charges. My parents and one of my sisters used to have accounts and all are closed now for the same reasons. I hate these guys. This account is closed as of Monday next week."
1189,SiteJabber,NA,"My elderly mother was contacted from the fraud Dept. with a query on her account activity. She was confused and unable to deal with the situation. I as executor called the fraud Dept. On her behalf. After nearly an hour on hold the call was answered and had to be transferred. After another 40 minutes my call was answered then disconnected 3 minutes into the call. I called again and after a 50 minute wait spoke to an Andrew who insisted he could only help me if I provided my mother's debit card number ( the one I have for said account was apparently insufficient)nor was providing the account number going to allow him to help me. When I said to Andrew this was freaking ridiculous he hung up on me. Get your act together Scotia Bank. Poor service and record profits,!"
1190,SiteJabber,NA,"If you want to get your day ruined go to this bank, any location is the same, the employees will make sure that you feel horrible after the transaction.

Shout out to Bathurst and Sheppard Branch, Vladimir you're the worst."
1191,SiteJabber,NA,"Worst bank I've been (I was client with 4 other banks in my lifetime). Been with them for 1 year. They don't call when they should for you to get your cards. They then send them back. Your online is then blocked. My credit card was fully paid every month. My checking account had over $5 000,00. After complaining (without any rudeness or threats) they decided to demarket me (close all my accounts, credits and never go back to them). When asked for a reason they answered that when opening my account I agreed they can close it when they want for whatever reason they want (fine prints). My daughter also applied for a credit card and was accepted. The branch (not same as mine) also never called her and sent the card back. When she enquired about it they yelled at her and told her she had to wait 3 months to re-apply. Search and you'll find similar cards from other banks.This bank is not worth it."
1192,SiteJabber,NA,"Got an auto loan which was all good, I then sold the car and visited a branch to pay off the loan, and take the difference, they kept the whole amount and said it had to be processed, that took 14 days. Never go to Scotiabank, you will never be Richer than you think!"
1193,SiteJabber,NA,"I got really bad mortgage advice and am now paying too much interest. It should have been locked in at a certain rate, that is what my mortgage was before at first national. With first national I received the best advice and rates."
1194,SiteJabber,NA,"Website for King & Nortflield in Waterloo says bank is open. I drove there and they are closed
Scotia bank doesn't care about it's customers, over the years I see a big decline in their service. I think it's time for me to change banks."
1195,SiteJabber,NA,Scotiabank has a black individual in one of their TV commercials that has a white girlfriend that states they will give their broken blender to the white girlfriend's father. This is the most dirtiest racist thing I've ever seen on television and I would definitely advise everyone not to use this racist Bank
1196,SiteJabber,NA,"We were told before we sold our house we could port our low 2.2% mortgage over to a new house, and we would get a refund on our fees paid. Well turns out Scotia bank can just decide not to do that and take over 2 months to get a call back after numerous calls to get this done. They don't want to pay the fees back or give out a low loan your entitled too cos they gave it to some1 else. Do not bank with them. Look at their reviews."
1197,SiteJabber,NA,If thier is an issue the manager or assistant manager are stupid tp the limite they have no minimum skills to solve snd they take more than usall time to solve an issues like things in tow days to solve it yake them over amonth snd the dont care and show no interest
1198,SiteJabber,NA,When it's comes to scotiabank everything is delay I have been banking with them over 15 years. Make a bill payment delay etransfer delay. Check deposit delay. Td has the same time frame but you don't have to wait for ages to wait around. Etransfer in seconds. Check deposits they say 5 days buy it process next day. Bill payment 3 business days but payments updated next business day. I can see my self slowly moving to Td
1199,SiteJabber,NA,"If you are waiting for the investment support to give you your money, you got a long wait. They tend to like to hold your money so they can collect interest. Takes the investment department weeks to process any withdrawals. Their ratings are terrible and I can see why. Terrible bank, will move all investments to another bank if they ever release my money, long overdue. Are they that broke?!"
1200,SiteJabber,NA,"Worst service ever at bank level with tellers, rude, and ignorant, and refused to look after me after asking for branch Manager at Tacoma Dr. in Dartmouth, NS. The branch Manager finally came out, and asked me to leave. I told her I would not be back to this branch again, after how I was treated, and she said good. I was trying to pay CRA for my mothers taxes, as she's with Alzheimer's."
1201,SiteJabber,NA,The worst software and application on the market. Each time! I try to go online to see my accounts it asks me to reset my current password. Online does not work. Each time you need to call customer rep - wait on the phone -answer their security questions -manually! = 19 century!to reset password with their support only. Unbelievable! Three times for ONE day it asked me to reset password. The same happened withxfriedn of mine! Shame
1202,SiteJabber,NA,"I called at 24/7 customer service number and after getting all my information when it was time to book an appointment for the issue i have, that person just cut my call without saying anything. I called twice and both of the time my call was down. Didn't even helped me with the issue."
1203,SiteJabber,NA,"I am a new customer to Scotia Bank, after having my account for only 2 weeks my account was frauded and now I cant reach anyone to get my money back. Worst service I have ever experienced. 2 hours on hold then to get an ignorant rep on the other end. Frustrating and unacceptable. I am searching for a new bank, I can never reach anyone to discuss my banking needs and when I do, they are of no help. People that are considering opening with Scotia bank look elsewhere. BEWARE!"
1204,SiteJabber,NA,"I had an upsetting issue on my account recently. Alexandra at Kingston Gardiners Rd location was awesome handling the issue. She was cheerful, personable and polite. I really appreciated her help in solving my problem."
1205,SiteJabber,NA,"I've never had a problem at my other bank.

I put a government cheque through my app and says it's on hold for 5 days….

I have bills to pay…

I don't think it's fair they can just hold money…

When I was with conexus, they never held any cheques. I switched to Scotia as my car loan is through them…

Not impressed"
1206,SiteJabber,NA,"I opened a chequing account with this bank since it had no transaction fees or monthly fees involved. After opening it was that way for quite some time but suddenly without letting me know they started charging a monthly fees even when I was well over the minimum balance to maintain. I called them to ask if the raised the min. Balance which the denied and said my account doesn't have that policy if I want I can switch to another account with no fees. Worst experience with this bank. They are cheats, stay away from this bank"
1207,SiteJabber,NA,"It has been more than two years i have been reported the fraud with my account and in the present no one is ready to help. I am running into different branches and fraud collections but they have no answers. There is a lady Miss Neha, she totally refused my call and to help me and then declined my call. I can't believe this $#*! that instead of sorting the things out, they prefer not to talk. This is so $#*!ing crazy. They are always transferring the calls to each other and still have 0 answers."
1208,SiteJabber,NA,"I have been dealing with Scotia Bank for the last ONE year. I have never come across any financial institution since 1973 that is so bad when it comes to customer service. NO ONE should open an account with Scotia Bank ever. I am trying and at the first opportunity, I will move my mortgage to another financial institution. I"
1209,SiteJabber,NA,"The customer service is so horrible. I was told 45 minute wait and was on the phone for upwards of 3hrs, that's the wait alone. I have had multiple issues with my online banking & my physical card itself. Go somewhere else!"
1210,SiteJabber,NA,I have been trying to reach a customer service representative about an international payment. It took me about 45 minutes to get hold of the first one and after 15 minutes she told me that she cannot help me with that and have to transfer my call to security department and I have to be on hold for 10 minutes its been more than an hour and I am still waiting for someone to answer the call and help me with the issue because I cannot afford to wait again but disconnecting the call. Worst customer service ever...
1211,SiteJabber,NA,"I'm disappointed with the service offered by this bank for a few reasons. Firstly, my credit card was stolen and I was put on hold on the phone for an hour to cancel my card, while the person who took my card was making purchases around town. They have yet to offer an option to cancel a credit card on their internet banking. Secondly, when I requested for a credit limit increase on my existing credit card I was not notified that my current card would be cancelled. I lost all my transaction history which I needed to get some funds reimbursed from work. Overall I think the services offered by this bank could be better. I wouldn't go with this bank for anything else other than basic banking."
1212,SiteJabber,NA,"We re seniors. We received money back from our income tax. We took the check to the closest branch to our home. Half of the money was put on hold for 5 days. This was a FEDERAL check... our taxes returned to us. We called or an explanation. We were at first told that it was not right for half to be held. In fact, it isn't. Federal money doesn't get a hold put on it. But they decided to keep the hold anyway saying that it was a different branch from ours. Note, our branch was not accessible to us due to construction on that day. We were never told the money would be held if deposited in another branch. So now half of our hard earned tax money isn't avaialble for 7 days because there is a weekend in the middle. Very disappointing."
1213,SiteJabber,NA,"I had fraud charges on my credit card. They said wait 30 days for reimbursement. They put a block on my credit card from that establishment so they could not put additional charges on it.
And not only did they still put even more charges on it. Scotia still won't reimburse any of the money charged. Im truly disgusted with them"
1214,SiteJabber,NA,"They will randomly decide to hold all of your money without notice for 7 days. I know it says 5 business days but that is actually one week. I've been with Scotia for 5 plus years and always had anything over 1000 held. Last week they decided pit of the blue and without notice to hold everything over 100 dollars. LMAO. 100 bucks to life on for a week. And I deposit 5 grand a month into that account. So no notice remember I said. So I didn't realize my car payment wouldn't go through until it didn't. Both my bank and car lenders charged me nsf fees. Even though the money was in my account. I've never had an issues, no red flags etc to make them change it from 1000 to 100. And they won't return my calls nor will they change it back. WORST BANK. And I'm
Spreading the word. I've already got 4 people to close their accounts and move to TD or RBC. ANYTHING BUT Scotia is good. Say no to Scotia. If you like to actually spend your hard earned money"
1215,SiteJabber,NA,"After being a customer of scotiabank for 20 plus years and 2 mortgages, one paid. They add up fees for over a year to accumulate a large sum and randomly take it out of your account when its the worst time lDuring covid every company or business has worked with us and been supportive except scotia bank. Without extra charges.the auto loan thru Scotia has repeatedly taken out extra and early payments requiring 2 hours of phone time to make them refund it.go anywhere else if you want to be treated with respect."
1216,SiteJabber,NA,"Bank won't release my LIRA. I met all the requirements to have it released early at 64yr, no income and retired. Been waiting months. They keep saying it's the government. First time it was her error. Reminded me today the age is 71yrs old. This after I told her I stopped spending money on food."
1217,SiteJabber,NA,"Spencer Davis from 91st Scotia bank sucks big time lies lies customer service sets you up for appointments that nobody no's nothing about,,you screwed my son over big time and i am gonna make sure your lieing $#*! fixes it,,,such a $#*!ty bank"
1218,SiteJabber,NA,"The worst customer service from Rhea, Ramir and Maria C at Nairn and Panet. So rude, they speak wile you are speaking, refuse to listen, holding for 40 minutes is commonplace. A debit memo of $400 was taken from my account and no one can tell me why. Rhea the Assistant Manager is the worst ambassador of any business. She could learn about client service from a 14 year old. She yelled at me, kept cutting me off, speaking while I was speaking, it was absurd. DO NOT trust these people with your finances and everything that you work hard for. Race discrimination is also rampant at the Nairn and Panet branch. 3 hours on the phone and no one can tell me where my money is."
1219,SiteJabber,NA,"Crap company. Lies upon lies. They don't answer phone calls and most locals don't have voice mail. If you're lucky enough to find a voice mail, they won't return your call anyway. Avoid Scotia"
1220,SiteJabber,NA,"Scotia has made some terrible mistakes. I called the customer care to block one of my credit cards, that i misplaced by accident. The customer care actually cancelled my debit card, as a result i lost my online access to debit card and other accounts. Grave mistake!"
1221,SiteJabber,NA,Do not open a account here. They are archaic and have no idea what they are doing. Going into my second week waiting for my pay to be released to me. And if you try to send a email to their complaints department thet block you. We are forced to trust them with our money and get charged fees foe services we are not getting. They are fraudulent thieves.
1222,SiteJabber,NA,Everything they do is inadequate... from their customer service to their brick and mortar locations. This bank is a joke. I spoke with a supervisor the other day and she told me to switch banks. I have never seen a bank with worse reviews.
1223,SiteJabber,NA,"If i can give a zero star i will give it them.

Branch and the online/call support keeps passing me between them. I think noone can can solve my issue with my mobile banking.

Please stay away from this bank if you dont want to deal with thier costumer service."
1224,SiteJabber,NA,"I'm so sorry that I cannot give zero or half a star to this business.
Zero or even negative stars to customer care and system taking care of customers.
The mortgage system and managing to increase the interest as per BOC approved
rate is unbelievable in comparison with TD, RBC and BMO.
2% increment in 2 months lol
It's like a bitter joke."
1225,SiteJabber,NA,"I am an existing customer and when you try to get anything done the people they have answering the phones are completely useless.

This is one of the most incompetent companies i have elver delt with they are even worse than the royal bank"
1226,SiteJabber,NA,"For 20 years I have had the same mail address and residence. Today I tried to get a new debit card, I get cheques and statements at this address but for some reason the girl could not understand that the mail address that for some reason was on my debit card was changed by Canada Post so she would not mail me one. I will take a long ride to my branch on Monday and transfer my money to a different bank. Visa and other debit cards have come to my address for years and years. She locked me out of online banking also."
1227,SiteJabber,NA,"Had schwduled a transfer between mt Scotiaban accounts for 1 Dec. Checked today at 8am PST couldnt find it anywhere so resent. Then checked later today and it had happened twice, sending my account into arrears it was between two current accounts where normally you see things immediately."
1228,SiteJabber,NA,This bank is notorious in restricting business banking. It is also notorious in delaying wire transfers. I am a business that deals with Cuba. This bank decided to close our account without giving a reason. My assumption is their fear of their masters in the US.
1229,SiteJabber,NA,"Stolen money multiple times. The bank and service is multiply by zero even federal regulated bank. The staff with authority to override security and automated transaction is simple diverse my money to their investing account and making profit on it. $******* now in inactive account making money someone els. The money was transfer to my broker investing account but never drives. In the same day someone on my web banking page create bill payment to Scotia I trade and simply revered my money there, in inactive and cancelled account that I never have exes to it. Staff was terrible, no one know anything, finally some buddy told me I have to wait 10 to 15 business days to get my money back. Shame on you!"
1230,SiteJabber,NA,"I tried to pull some money from a ATM, the machine did not dispense any money but still deducted the money from my account. I reported the matter and over a month and a half later my money hasn't been returned. If you were pulling the money for an emergency and this happened to you, Scotia Bank would leave you high and dry. They only care about the customers money not the customer. I also have another bank account with a different bank, and this same incident occurred and my money was returned to my account in exactly three working days after reporting the incident to that bank; that shows you the difference in characteristics and customer care of Scotia Bank and other banks."
1231,SiteJabber,NA,"27-year issue cannot be resolved. Beyond ridiculous. The bank reached out to me and told me it would be worth my while to pay them back fees... and they will not release assets. Do not work with this bank, I warn you. I want to speak to any media or journalist that will listen to warn others about this issue that is happening to others."
1232,SiteJabber,NA,"I recently contacted Scotia bank regarding my queries and they guided my very well and help to sort all problems. I specially like to thank Miriam mam, she is really a good person as well as a employee. Thank you."
1233,SiteJabber,NA,"I opened a saving account, but I did not get the interest, and their staff told me I will get it later since I just signed up for the account. After a couple of months of the investigation, the investigator, Hannah B, promised she will credit me back the interest and sent me a letter to sign it. She also mentioned I will get my fund back within 5-7 business days. It had been a month now, and she never credit me back the fund, and she just did not reply. Very dishonest and unprofessional banking service."
1234,SiteJabber,NA,Zero rating for their customer service which is almost non-existent. Their credit cards and mobile app are very unreliable. You just get locked out for no reason. The branch tells you it's not their problem and they ask you to call customer service which you'd have to wait 2-3 hours for. Then you get passed around different departments for 2 more hours only to be told to go to the branch for help. They use third party customer service which you can't understand on the phone. They avoid trying to help you and try to refer everything to their incompetent phone customer service. They don't have any accountability. The WORST customer service in any business I have dealt with in Canada.
1235,SiteJabber,NA,Ive tried to reach their credit card support and I have to wait over 40 mins reaching close to 2hrs all the time. Such a waste of time. The customer reps are not helpful at all. I was told to activate the card via web since they cant do it on their side. Web was getting errors and now I have to wait over 40 mins again. I will never get another Scotiabank product after I cancel everything from them.
1236,SiteJabber,NA,Was on the phone for an hour. Trying to get these nsf charges reversed. Due to unauthorized transaction on my account. The agent and manager did not want to refund the account. Even when i called those merchants it was fraud. Even though i did not authorize it. I still had to pay. The agent kept on telling me it wasnt the banks fault that i got charged the nsf. It wasnt my fault either. But i still had to pay. This bank just ripped me off. For something i did not authorize.
1237,SiteJabber,NA,"1-long waiting to reach them in the phone
2-Bad customer service, many times i called and explain to solve my problem but the didn't, my problem was i did a balance transfer on the phone one time but they repeated twice, and they didn't fixed their mistake. Now I called my other bank and i solved my problem by my self...
3.I had %0 interest rate for balance transfer and thats why i used but now they are charging me for interest and i called them they said yes you have 0 interest but we charging you for (balance transfer fee interest) but this is first time for me to hear interest on fees."
1238,SiteJabber,NA,"I wait an average of 45 mins in line and today I waited 40 mins to talk to a phone representative. Scotiabank made 2.6 billion profit in 1 quarterly report 2022. I guess the key to profit now is to screw the customer that provides the basis of your business - I have not received interest on my money since the early '90s. The most ungrateful, lackluster bank in the world. I can't get my money out fast enough!"
1239,SiteJabber,NA,"I recently paid off the line of credit and the ""value visa"" on July 31st at the branch. I was told that the deposits would be held for 5 business days, which means the accounts would be cleared today Aug 9th. When I checked on line the amounts are still pending. I phoned the idiots and their so called customer service department only to find out that the moron's put a 7 business day hold on my deposits at the branch not the 5 days indicated. I feel that I have been lied to by Scotia Bank... Can't wait to have these accounts cleared as I will be closing them down. Never in my life have I been treated this way after being with Scotia for more than 25 years... I'm done!"
1240,SiteJabber,NA,My bank sent a transfer request to Scotiabank to release my money but it had been more than 6 weeks and Scotiabank still help my money up. I heard they did this to other clients too. Not to be trusted I feel bad I have to put one star cause I do not have to.
1241,SiteJabber,NA,I've been. Customer Scotia bank. Many. Years I put a insurance cheq in. Account. They. Hold funds. They think. Insurance. Company. Will. Bounce there cheq. There not. Fraud. Government. Might. And hold there cheq not. Happy. Thinking. Of. Finding. New. Back. If. I. Go. My whole. Family. Will. Go so they. Will have a lot. People leave they have. Friends as well as I do. Keep. It up Scotia bank. You keep treating. People. Like this you. Will be out business
1242,SiteJabber,NA,Just terrible service from customer service to branch manager in Cobourg Ontario. They locked me out of my account and stole my money. They will not return my money or let me back into my account. I've contacted everyone I can and they can't help me and are very clueless as to what is going on. It's really to bad a bank would need to steal money. I would give 0 stars to Scotia Bank
1243,SiteJabber,NA,"I had problems with my credit card but it could not be changed so I had to cancel it. Unfortunately, my accounts were closed to ( not what I wanted) & I had to threatened to take the Ba k to small claims court to get my money. They did not answer my messages. Horrible service."
1244,SiteJabber,NA,"Worst bank to deal with. There plattform is failing constantly and then it takes ages to get someone on the phone. The representatives on the phone are somewhere outside the country and can't really help. It cost you hours of work time, to fix minor problems. No worth it."
1245,SiteJabber,NA,"Worst experience ever, the hold time of customer service was more than 3hours. I didn't call to beg for anything, It's my right being the customer to obtain my rewards attained, if you can't provide me service. You aren't eligible to manage my money. I will definitely change my bank, such worst experience."
1246,SiteJabber,NA,"Scotiabank had a chance to get some of my business but they weren't smart enough to have Colpatria, a bank owned by Scotiabank on it's preferred banks for reduced ATM fees. Scotiabank is not bright in figuring out competitive advantages."
1247,SiteJabber,NA,"The customer service is absmal - the worst I have experience experienced in my life. I have to call about 5-10 times everytime I need a card delivered. Honestly, I almost feel like it is useless to call customer service because they quite literally never do the thing they say they will do to the point that they are just simply saying things. It has been a very stressful experience everytime and just based on these experiences, I would simply recommend to never make a bank account with this bank. Especially if you are someone whose bank account is the only way for them to access their money. Its quite exploitative of a bank to be so incredibly lazy to make it so hard for me to do simple things like access their bank account since money is the primary means to live."
1248,SiteJabber,NA,"Went on line to open an account. Went through the process. Then received an email saying account couldn't be opened on line, come to the branch. So I wrote back saying forget it, don't want an account.
Few days later received a debit card! Didn't bother to activate it since I have no account. Few weeks later received another email saying I have a negative account!.
So called the bank, ""they were experiencing a large call volume"". 25 minutes later somebody came on line. Listened to me but couldn't help and passed me on. This second person is trying to help, says bank charged me an account fee hence the negative bank! She is going to reverse the charges and close the account but I have to stay on line. Writing this review while waiting. Now 15 minutes and counting.
DON'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR THIS BANK"
1249,SiteJabber,NA,"I had a terrible experience trying to resolve a re-access to my online account, I had 2 guys on the phone, the first one was clueless and the second one same thing and to make the thing worse he transferred me to a department where they made me wait for eternity? Scoatia bank you being serious? Really? Worst banking experience ever."
1250,SiteJabber,NA,"I'd never expect to get what i lost in financial situation but Miss Salo made it possible. I'm a hard worker person aged 27 working everyday but somebody spent my whole money for their purchases, they made unauthorised transactions from my debit. I explained my situation to Miss Salo and she helped me a lot. She's the best and respectful. She promised to call me on following day bcz her computer system wasn't working and yes i got a call from her on the second day as she promised. Hence if there's bad people living in this world so are the good people too.
Thank you so much Miss Salo
There's a small complaint about another representative name Diego, I explained him everything and he didn't take any action, didn't even block my debit.He transferred my call to fraudulent officer which took around 60 minutes and i hung up bcz it was around 1:30 am.On the second day more of money got deducted as unauthorised transaction.He wasn't even that nice to me."
1251,SiteJabber,NA,"Absolute $#*! company. I've had issues ever since I set up my debit card with them. It's just one thing after the other, first the pin wasn't working, then it's the verification. It doesn't even show a change in my balance once I've received or taken out money. I don't know what's going on but it is so frustrating. I have other things to do than wait on a thirty minute call waitlist to get a representative to deal with an issue I shouldn't even have in the first place."
1252,SiteJabber,NA,"They offered a special interest rate on a new account. In order to get the interest you had to keep the funds locked in for 5 months. After 5 months they refused to pay citing some small print in their agreement. And they also refused to reconsider since I do not have a mortgage with them (I already paid it off) and because I do not keep 100,000+ in my bank account with them (it is invested with their Itrade division)."
1253,SiteJabber,NA,"You even have their customer service agents transferring you to other customer service agents, for a repeat of your initial wait time, almost as if the last 30-45 mins wait was non-existent. Being on their call for over 2hrs and no resolution to linking the scotia card and the scene card which is meant to be an automatic process."
1254,SiteJabber,NA,"Scotiabank is possibly the worst banking experience I've had. They seem stuck in the dark ages in terms of accessibility, online capacities, training and professionalism of their staff, etc. I have a mortgage and LOC at SB and tried to set-up online banking so I could view my history and statements. Nope. Then I sat on hold on a phone for 1 hr! They don't even have the 'we'll call you back' option! Once I got them on the phone I went through three people and none could help. They said I was missing a card that the bank should have given me when I got the LOC, or I could have the mortgage dept set me up but I'd have to call them. I wondered why I wasn't set up when I got my mortgage if they know how clunky their system is, or why I wasn't given the card with my LOC that is necessary to use with their online tool. So. Frustrating. When I renew my mortgage I will NOT stay with SB."
1255,SiteJabber,NA,I bank with 2 other canadian banks but decided to open a credit account with scotiabank. It sucks to be treated this way. I lost my credit card and I just moved. My branch says i have to call the online customer service to report that and request a new one. I called the first time and was put on hold for 1hour and the guy picked up but the call hung up for some reason. I called again more furious this time and i gave the lady who picked up that time my number to callback. I had requested a new credit card and she said i would not be able to do that for 30days cause my address was just changed. What does that even mean Scotia? Im utterly disappointed. The call hung up again and i waited hours and no call back. I tried calling again today and was put on hold for an hour and the call hung up. I am frustrated and will be closing this account
1256,SiteJabber,NA,"Incredibly rude customer service agent didn't understand what I was asking for, and once he understood what I was wanting (he was mis understanding) he was rude saying I should of explained it more, well he should of understood better. Needless to say the agent hung up on me. I HATE Scotia bank and will be cancelling and never dealing with them again."
1257,SiteJabber,NA,I've been trying to get a credit limit increase for the past hour. I've been passed between 3 reps. The first took 20 minutes only to tell me he can't help but he'll transfer me to someone that can. The second asked the same set of questions and said he was transferring me to credit specialists when he knew that my intention was to start a new credit application and not just get a status update. The third realized that the second scumbag wasn't supposed to direct me to her and now she's transferred me to another department. I can't wait till they go belly up.
1258,SiteJabber,NA,"Hi,
I opened up an saving account on-line but the website was not direct and it opened an ultimate package also. I went to my branch and they charged me $20.00 to close an account that I had not used at all. I told them that I had a mortgage renewal coming up and is there anything the supervisor (Ramnik Sanghara) could do. They said no and made me pay for an account that I did not use. I cancelled all accounts. I have a TD bank account and it has 10 times better service.
Makes sense why this bank is losing more clients to TD Bank."
1259,SiteJabber,NA,"Can't wait to move every dollar we have there to another bank. Can't wait to move our mortgage to another bank too. They told my wife that she has to pay $10,000 so our monthly mortgage payments don't go up. She did and payments went up $600 because she did what they asked for. They said they can't give her money back nor move it to another account even tho it's her money and transfer would have been between her own accounts. There's no other bank like that and I've been to 3rd world countries."
1260,SiteJabber,NA,Reported my ScotiaCard lost by phone on Dec 22-21 & replacement card was to be mailed to me. NOT rec'd by Jan 6-22 so got card at bank branch. I never did receive the mailed card as of Jan 21-22. I've sent 3 e-mails & 1 written letter to Scotiabank 'President' re: this + a Scotiabank call center issue & rec'd NO reply! NOW a month later I've written the CEO to complain about this banks totally useless complaints dept. I now see this bank is rated 161'ST among banking sites--I believe it!
1261,SiteJabber,NA,"I was waiting in line for 40 min outside the bank, when I got in there were more people in line, because there were only 2 tellers working. When I complained about it they told me to leave the bank.

It was in Niagara Fall S bank on Thorold Stone Str."
1262,SiteJabber,NA,Just had to wait 30min. Finally talk to someone who was very hard to understand and they didn't seem to understand me either. Was just asking if a credit card I closed years ago still had money oweing on it. The customer service not listen to me and send my call to trans Canada credit due to I just mentioned I was looking at my rating and seen there was an outstanding balance. What I was calling about had nothing to really do with my rating but they jump right on that and directed my call to them.
1263,SiteJabber,NA,"You can't call someone at your bank, you have to go through a central station that sucks. I have my money in the BNS but I'm getting so pissed off I'm go in to change banks. Any recommendations? My investment advisor hasn't contacted me in over a year and I have a lot of $ in my investment acc5s."
1264,SiteJabber,NA,"I tried to send money to my family overseas. Unfortunately the wire got lost, my mom never got the money. However, Scotiabank returned the money into my account, even though they didn't get the money back. Not until 4 months later. When they called me again, saying they finally got the wire back. So they asked if I wanted to send the wire one more time.
The staff of Scotiabank is trustful, ethical, and really competent. The Scotiabank assistant Parik"", he was so polite and even talked to me in Spanish, since is my mother tongue, making it easy for my to understand."
1265,SiteJabber,NA,"Very poor customer service. I am extremely unsatisfied. After 5 phone calls, getting disconnected, and 1 in location visit I recived a phone call from a very unhelpful manager who contacted me from #*******018. I was jerked around for 3months trying to transfer funds from TD to a 0 interest rate card Scotia offered me on a 6month promotional deal. By the time I reached a service person who was able to transfer my funds half the promotion was over. When I asked that they Honor the 6month offer I was told the 3month delay was my fault. I blame it on their customer service agents having strong accents and a lack of understanding each other.
I do not recommend dealing with this instatution."
1266,SiteJabber,NA,"I've been a customer at Scotia bank for over 20 years. I carry a $******* balance in my chequing account, and don't receive a penny of interest. There was a mix up with my US dollar visa that I hadn't used in over a year, was on hold for over 40 mins, hung up on once, was on the line for over 1 1/2 hrs simply to get a new visa, guess what still no visa. I went to BMO MasterCard, applied on line and within 5 mins was approved. WTF I've never been a BMO customer but my US account is now going to be transferred there and more then likely all my business will find its way there. Sorry Scotia you have completely and utterly fail at and resemblance of customer service. Your call centre is a complete failure."
1267,SiteJabber,NA,"I was fed up with their useless customer service so I moved all my money to a different institution. I moved my RRSP and my TFSA. It took 40 days and there is over $2500 missing. Lying, thieving, conniving, charlatan, con-artist shysters! Just remember Scotiabank, payback is a B****H!"
1268,SiteJabber,NA,I was a new first time investor and I trusted my financial advisor who I met at first at Scotia and I didn't realize what I was investing into really- but I didn't even realize I could lose as much as I did because I was a first time investor. I don't even know why I would have signed up for medium/high risk investment when I didn't even have an income and had explained that I wanted to keep my money safe. I noticed my account losing money within 6 months of setting up investment. I really couldn't afford to lose money but I pulled my investment cause it was making me really nervous how much it was going down. I really wished my advisor had my back more & I wish the investor profile had more useful & detailed questions like BMO's questions are more specific & they do a better job at making sure your investments match up with your situation. Hopefully Scotiabank changes their investment set ups so people are more aware of what they are signing up for.
1269,SiteJabber,NA,I have had a Scotia account since I was like 12 years old. Since I hit my 20s I have had a terrible experience. They don't care about their customers. I have called multiple times for help and received zero. I just got told they didn't mail my bank card to my house but my branch instead. So in the middle of a pandemic in Canada I have to got my branch and get a card. Icing on the cake is that they are only open 9:30-5pm latest at this location which is when I and the majority of the population work. The second I pay everything off I will be canceling my account. RBC is much more useful and helpful. I hate Scotia with a passion. Or did I mention they also charge me 55 dollars in account fees.
1270,SiteJabber,NA,"Do not deposit a cheque you may end up like me! I deposited an almost stale dated cheque it still had 3 days to go. It actually cleared from the issuing business on the same date! The bank threatened to charge me with fraud for attempting to pass a bad cheque!
It's 3 mths later and there's still a hold on my acct! Nobody will release the hold eventhough there's been 0 days left on my acct and has been 0 days left for well over a week. I've left numerous messages with the top 3 people at my branch over the last 10 days I've left 4 messages with the office of the president and no return call, nothing! The line is so busy with people complaining that you have to leave a message and callback number! Worst bank I've ever dealt with by far! Worst customer service not to mention my money being held hostage for 3 months when it cleared the day it was deposited!"
1271,SiteJabber,NA,"If someone has a fraud issue don't even bother to ask for help because THEY JUST DONT CARE! There isn't any help! I REGRET being a Scotiabank client. Don't know what's going on but it is so frustrating. I have other things to do than wait on a 45 minutes call waitlist to get a representative to deal with an issue I shouldn't even have in the first place. However after waiting this much they ALWAYS transfer you, ops hanged up on you. Try it again, took me today 5 hours for an answer! Never again!"
1272,SiteJabber,NA,"Scotiabank has made so much money from clients its unimaginable for most of us, but call for any kind of customer ""service"" and well there is NO customer service, just LIP service.
It is unacceptable that they expect people to sit of the phone waiting over 45 minutes for someone to take the call.
The thing is Scotiabank has a major share holder named The Vanguard Group who owns everything along with BlackRock. They want to reduce already pathetic support to less than it is NOW and expect you to be happy (see The Great Reset by The World Economic Forum).
Soon coming is Digital ID and Digital credit system. This complaint may end up reducing my ability to bank, buy goods or services. DO NOT REGISTER OR ACCEPT THE NEW DIGITAL ID OR DIGITAL CURRENCY, YOU WILL REGRET IT - READ ABOUT IT IN CHINA."
1273,SiteJabber,NA,"I bought 5 years financial institutes GICs in my RRSP at different banks, TD, Scotiabank, Royal Bank, and matured in one month or two apart in 2020. Returns from TD and Royal Bank almost the same -- reached cap 20% while returns from Scotiabank were 2.287 and 4.28 over 5 years. Terrible experience with Scotiabank. My money invested in Scotiabank made me much poorer than I think."
1274,SiteJabber,NA,"You wonder why people go to other banks, no matter how valuable you are as a client at this bank, they are the worse for taking care of the clients. Worst service ever"
1275,SiteJabber,NA,Poor agent and unprofessional customer service. I have to make a three-time call to dispute one charge to my visa account by providing all the evidence.
1276,SiteJabber,NA,"This company cares about one thing and one thing only... MONEY! Every year they must make more and more money than the year before. This means making the employees life more miserable and also giving less and less value to the customer.

Working here is also awful. Poor pay and very salesy. Free speech is non existant here. You are constantly told what to say to the customer. They also weaponize empathy. Working at the call center is brutal. The wait times are very high. A problem that can be fixed by hiring a couple more people but the bank can't seem to do that because you know. Money..."
1277,SiteJabber,NA,"I have been a Scotiabank customer for close to 40 years and I have to say they have hit a new low. As they increase our rates the service they provide is horrible. One can no longer call directly to a branch but rather have to go through a call center where just about every individual I spoke to does not have a grasp of the English language. Additionally, the last few small business advisors and mortgage specialists are horrible. They do not return calls or follow up. Over 2 years ago I sold my corporation and Scotiabank could not figure out how to transfer all the corporation accounts to the new owners. For over 2 years I could see their credit card statements and they were allowed to use my credit. The only way to resolve this was for the new owners to change banks and I closed the business credit card. I made multiple calls to stop this breach of confidentiality and wrote two formal complaints and no one even bothered to follow up. Who are these people? It seems to me that Scotiabank's goal is to take our money and not deal with us. I wonder if all banks are this pathetic?"
1278,SiteJabber,NA,"Please use any other bank, this bank is awful, you've been warned. Customer services is terrible. You wait 20 min and get to talk to someone who can barley speak English."
1279,SiteJabber,NA,"I got this card a few months ago thinking it would be great to earn points towards free movies. It has never worked properly for me. First, I couldn't link the Visa to my Scene card as I'd keep getting an error on their site. Their push notification service doesn't work, and since they require two step verification to log in to either mobile or web, I have been unable to log in to either since I got it, making me have to call every month to get my balance from their automated system while not being able to verify the charges on the account. Third, every time I've tried calling to find a solution to the issue, I get put on hold; the minimum time they have ever had me on hold for is 45 minutes. So I just hang up. It doesn't matter what day or what time of day you call - they will always put you on hold for an eternity. I have a number of cards and not one of them has ever left me on hold to get in contact with customer service - they answer the phone in seconds. I will be cancelling this card immediately and will never look back - Scotiabank has the absolute worst customer service of any bank in living memory and the hassle of dealing with them is not worth the credit they've extended."
1280,SiteJabber,NA,"Is less than poor, unacceptable wait time, 45 minutes plus, have a mobile security which defaults frequently, have had no mobile banking for 8 plus days as I am blocked"
1281,SiteJabber,NA,"Scotiabank just kicked an Albert man out of the bank and wouldn't let him access his money because he didn't share there political views,don't use Scotiabank"
1282,SiteJabber,NA,Worse customer service out of all the major banks...i waited over an hour to get through and the customer service representative hung up on me for no apparent reason!
1283,SiteJabber,NA,"Why don't you hire individuals who know how to speak English properly or at least understand what clients are trying to say? I called customer service and the individual on the other end informed me that my request was not possible. After explaining the situation and getting visibly frustrated suddenly she began working on what I called in for. She acted like she understood what I was saying, spoke over me and then continued to ask the same questions repeatedly. Im confident this was due to a langauge barrier. When a customer calls in they expect to be understood when they are speaking it's not an unreasonable request. A customer should not have to go through this. It makes something that's relatively simple become very complicated. After ending the call I decided to call back to confirm if my request was being processed because I did not feel confident in the agents abilities. The second individual was rude, also did not have adequate English skills and continued to ask irrelevant questions. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor and she hung up on me. I have nothing against individuals who have accents; However, it's not unreasonable to expect to be understood and not have to repeat things 5 times or be told something that is false. Something so simple becomes far more complicated. After many years of banking with Scotiabank I am inclined to cancel all services and take my money and business elsewhere and I know that I am not the only one who feels this way."
1284,SiteJabber,NA,Was going to buy a rental condo out west with rent income of 2k plus I make 8k per month and 20% down of 150k. Their underwriter turn my mortgage down. So they lost over 330k of interest and I am out of a nice condo out west.
1285,SiteJabber,NA,Thank you so much Camela madam for an amazing customer service to help me to get back in to my online banking really appreciate your work. Hope you have a great day mam.
1286,SiteJabber,NA,"I have experienced this few times, not once with various transactions. The last one being a trial wire transfer transaction of a small amount. The transaction didn't go through as the paying bank address was types as customer address. I didn't catch this while digning the WT form, my bad. Bank charged me WT Feww of USD29 and an additional USD20 to credit back by USD100. When requested to resend the WT, they said they with again charge me WT. At that stage, I gave up with a loss of USD 49 for the transaction that didn't go through. The general attitude is to rip of customer without providing any better service. I will close the account at the very first opportunity."
1287,SiteJabber,NA,"The web site is not working and the staff in the branches are masters of NOT doing things! Big, slow and lazy type of organizations that you should stay away..."
1288,SiteJabber,NA,"The mortgage department is horrible. The mortgage agent are not trained and have zero finance knowledge at the Whitby branch. If you call the head office try to get someone from Maritime provinces. It will save you time. The solutions you will get are not outside of box, shows you can read about it online and come up with it yourself. I would recommend go to BMO, TD, RBC or any other bank. SCOTIA IS RED FOR A REASON A RED FLAG. GET READY TO GO THRU GENERAL CUSTOMER TO LOANS TO COLLECTION TO GENERAL CUSTOMER TO FINALLY GET TO MORTGAGE.

Reserve 4-5 hours of your day when calling scotiabank"
1289,SiteJabber,NA,"My US pension is to be deposited and made available to me, on the 3rd of every month. Scotiabank DOES NOT follow the rules, nor the law, and forces me to wait up to 30 days before depositing MY MONEY into MY ACCOUNT! When I enquire about why the delays are happening, I am told they don't understand why, because there are no holds on my account. I call BS, because there have to be holds somewhere within Scotiabank. This money grubbing POS bank, is one of the absolute worst, on every, single level!"
1290,SiteJabber,NA,"Although Scotiabank TV ads claim that customers rate the bank's online services the highest in Canada, my experience is that the service is just so-so. The ATM machines have complex or poorly designed screens and the machine gives cash before the customer withdraws the card, resulting in cards that are frequently left in the machine. Moreover, the online service and ATMs are often out-of-order resulting in repeated attempts/visits. Security for online services, including that provided by third parties, is excessive and frustrating. For example, I cannot reorder cheques online because my last order was two years ago. If there was a problem with my account, I am sure it would have shown up before now. I have to visit a branch to reorder--brilliant idea with COVID! The best thing the bank has done for customer service since the good old days when you had to visit the bank for everything is to increase their opening hours. Online service is too unreliable; at least with banking hours there is some stability."
1291,SiteJabber,NA,Ive been involved in a Fraud with someone who has sent me a Fraudulent check and I've Talked to The Customer Service they said the Fraud Department handles these Types of Problems and someone From the Fraud Department said that the issue might be resolved in 14 days but its been more than 14 days and Issue hasn't even Been Resolved Yet im Really Fed up with this bank my Account is Still locked and I can't even conduct online banking scotiabank has slow Service and I'd Not even Recommend scotiabank to someone I'd rather Open a Bmo Account Right now to be able to conduct online banking...
1292,SiteJabber,NA,"Literally the worst bank! They have the worst customer service, it takes an hour and a half to get a hold of anyone and when you do they are not helpful. Don't bother wasting your time with this bank"
1293,SiteJabber,NA,"I've been trying to get a credit card for the past year and a half. Have had 3 meetings, sent multiple T4's, sent multiple paystubs, have done calls and emails back and forth. Now they're trying to call my boss, which is unprofessional its none of they're business to go and bug him about me getting a credit nor is it his business. Not only that, I have to have a credit card due to the fact I'm travelling and staying at a hotel in a few days, but they still haven't. And most paid parking will only allow you to pay with a credit card. A year and a half ago, they said I should receive it in the mail in 10-14 days and its been a year and a half. They have a very dragged out unnecessary process, when my friends with other banks have gotten one, ordered online and got it in 2 weeks, no issues. So if you're trying to get a credit card at Scotiabank, good luck. They will tell you it's coming then won't respond to you for weeks/months until you bug and bug them, then will add another requirement on top of another. They will make it almost impossible to get."
1294,SiteJabber,NA,"Customer for over 20yr paid off accts and mortgages time and time again. Just paid 20k line of credit in sept and im constantly getting calls if im a few days late to pay 19.00 and 50.00 over due on my acct. Very annoying. I called to inquire and tge rep actually asked me if i could pay $19.00
Seriously... i just paid $20,000.00 lump sum... terrible cytomer service"
1295,SiteJabber,NA,It was really great experience to talk to Customer representative (Mackenzie) to resolve my banking issues. I feel so glad. Thank you Mackenzie for your wonderful support.
1296,SiteJabber,NA,The service was horrendous. The interest rate is very high on loans. You do not get any interest on saved monies at this institution. Tax is always drawn from your account
1297,SiteJabber,NA,"I've been a Scotiabank customer for more than 20 years, and I'm seriously ready to switch banks at this point.
Two months in a row, they've drained my entire account, claiming it was because of ""monthly service fees,"" which are only supposed to be an X amount per month.
But no, they proceeded to take every last dime, and leave me with a huge negative balance, both times.
And when I called the number on the back of the card about it, the woman I spoke to basically laughed at me on the phone and said, ""Too bad.""
How's that for sh*tty customer service?
The first time it happened, they did reimburse in the end, after I threatened to take my business elsewhere, which was when they suddenly turned and claimed they didn't want to lose me as a customer.
They reimbursed me FOR FOURTEEN F'N DOLLARS.
What a joke.
The second time it happened, they refused to reimburse anything. And gave me attitude about it in the process.
So sick of feeling like I'm being robbed by these crooks month after month."
1298,SiteJabber,NA,"This is terrible customer service there was a ""Karren"" and they would be sassy and would be saying that I did not know what I was doing. So please for your reputation fire Suzen."
1299,SiteJabber,NA,I have been dealing with this bank for over twenty years and every time I need to do business with them the surprises me with their integrity and genuine willingness to help there customers
1300,SiteJabber,NA,"Very inhuman bank. No mercy, as a low income like me, I can only pay a staggered payment not one time to their sky rocket interest on top of my debt. I been so long in scotia, and recently I experienced this kind of very inconvenient payment they did to me, all my salary from my checking they took all for the interest. I am so devastating where now I i will a money to feed my family, pay some of my debt. SCOTIA BANK VERY VERY VERY INHUMAN."
1301,SiteJabber,NA,"Scotia Bank spent ages talking me into renewing with them on a 5 year term even though we were planning on selling soon. Long story short. When we did sell, we were told what our buyout of the mortgage would be only to bring the paperwork to layers and receive a bill from Scotia for thousands. 5000$ over our original quote to buyout. When we inquired, it ends up that the paperwork had been dealt with one day after the date of our buyout date that they had originally quoted. This bumped out payment up over 5000$. They had not said a thing tonus about the date and absolutely refuse to budge on it. After stating that the amount was not fair or what had been agreed upon, they actually laughed at me out loud on the phone and said I had to or they would simply use legal means to fine me. This is the end to a horrible experience for years with this bank. A bad experience to top off all the years previous of horrible customer service. Do not trust your money in the hands of this bank. They will not respect it or keep it safe."
1302,SiteJabber,NA,"Bunch of idiots who steal from customers! Don't waste your time, find another bank. There are many other banks out there that are much more deserving of your business!"
1303,SiteJabber,NA,"They charged my old parents $400 without their permission, we complained but they did no care.

We will complain to next steps.

They should not rape off old people"
1304,SiteJabber,NA,Bmo much better bank. Scotia is obsurdly ignorant and disrespectful to new customers. There is no scotia 222 queen I went walked a mile with a broken knee to be treated this way
1305,SiteJabber,NA,"Unprofessional tele caller in Scotia bank, I'm traveling to abroad, they don't even understand what is abroad word? They changed to 4 costumer representative, no one understand simple prob."
1306,SiteJabber,NA,"They Don't know which thing is handled by which department, they keep transfering and every transfer take s aprox 45 mins, it took 3 hrs for my smal issue to be resolved because of their wait times
I don't why do they charge this much monthly charge despite noty having anyone to assist in less than 10 mins ant any point of time
Worst bank ever

1307,SiteJabber,NA,"The staff, Sammy from China, who works at uptown branch in Victoria. She is very rude and impolite. She is very unhelpful and unfriendly. The worst customer service I ever met."
1308,SiteJabber,NA,"I visited the Robb St location today to do a withdrawal. The line was long at peak time 12:30, anyhow when I finally got inside about 12:55, I was told that only one machine was working and the security said the 3rd machine from the door should be on to try and see. Anyhow I did tried but it was null and void. I tried the first transaction but it said confirmed and when I did my card came out, so I tried again and same thing. So I decided to check my email to see if the transactions came through and they did but I didn't received any money. I lured the help of the CSR rep on ground zero and she said that I have to do a dispute and wait 2 weeks before I can get my money anyhow I told her to go to her superior and she returned and said this afternoon about 17:00 hrs it will be rectify and funds returned. It's 19:00 hrs and no funds. Like seriously scotiabank bank, is it my fault that your system was faulty and you could have checked your cameras there and then and see that no money came out even 2 transactions were made. Plus you didn't even bother to ask my state of urgency for my money but just dismissed my rave. I am a customer even if I it's $2 I have in my account, so better understanding should have been showed. The supervisor didn't even bother to come out to say something to appease the situation, so its clear that it has happened already for the period.
My first review happens to be a terrible one and i will continue to post until this is rectify."
1309,SiteJabber,NA,"I left Canada without closing my account in SCOTIA BANK and without taking or sending my money to France. This is SCOTIA'S POLICY:
- they do not transfer my money in France I request by email — but they said me by phone+mail this is possible; now they say I have to send a fax
- they do not send me any information about the transfer rate
- they blocked all possibilities for any online transfer in my account (transfer between my accounts, Interac, and Western Union).
- they do not accept refund of money (checks) from my Canadian Social Security (I have to deposit personally in the bank in Montreal)
- they do not permit me to make any changing in my account
- they did not pay me the amount I earned by using a ""Savings"" account for 1 year (they say because my Social Security ended)
•• DO NOT EVER OPEN AN ACCOUNT IN SCOTIA BANK. IT IS THE MOST AGRESSIVE POLICY I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED WITH A BANK in 4 different countries (France, Greece, USA, Canada).
•• DO NOT LEAVE YOUR MONEY IN CANADA!"
1310,SiteJabber,NA,It has been 90 days since this started my account was compromise about $3000 was sent out in e transfers. I got a refund to my account in 10 days. I spent 2 hours on hold trying to reach the fraud department. It then happened again another $3000 was sent out in e transfers this time they took almost 30 days to investigate and refund the stolen funds. I had to spend 6 hours on hold trying to reach the fraud department. They are unable to tell me why this is happening I was told it was my fault my devise must be compromised take it to best buy and have it inspected was the only help I could get. I go into the bank trying to get help they tell me online banking has nothing to do with the branch you must call the 1 800 number to get help. I now have not been able to sign into my bank account for over 30 days not being able to deposit the rent sent to my from my tenants via e transfer for 2 months now They are unable to help at the 1 800 line they sent it into the investigation department supposed to be 5 days was 2 week before I heard from them. They called said it was fixed wanted me to sign in from my farm tractor the tractor is not equipped with a I pad. When I got back to the house at 7 pm the temporary pass word did not work. After 1 hour on hold another pass word they gave me did not work. Call back again 2 hours on the phone they want to send it for review again will get back to me in 8 days. I would never get a scotiabank account it is October 11 this started in August and I will get more info about the investigation by October 19 rent money still in etransfer limbo.
1311,SiteJabber,NA,"Scotiabank has the best customer service be it on the phone or in person at the bank. I called and spoke with ELMAR tonight on the phone and he was so patient, thorough and extremely helpful. Every interaction i have had in regards to anything with Scotiabank has always been positive, they are THE BEST bank to deal with.
THANK YOU TO ALL THE LOVELY STAFF OF SCOTIABANK EVERYWHERE"
1312,SiteJabber,NA,"If you want timely, efficient posting of account transactions, do it with another bank. And fi you want
Efficient local in person banking do not go to the Kelowna Dilworth branch."
1313,SiteJabber,NA,"Woke up this morning unable to access my savings account which holds all of my funds. When I contacted them to find out why, I was told it was due to site maintenance and is expected to be done by 6pm. I explained that I didn't recieve an email or text giving me any notice this would be happening or I would have transferred funds ahead of time. I was told I did get a notification but it's only sent to my app or online messages on my Scotiabank account. So I would only see the message if I logged on and noticed it myself. I explained that i needed access to my funds as my 12 year old daughter had a volleyball tournament out of town today. And I have no options to borrow and shouldn't have to. I was basically told it wasn't their problem and there was nothing they could do to help. So now my daughter will miss her tournament after working so hard just to make it to that level. I can never give this day back to my daughter and Scotiabank could not care less. I will be closing my account as soon as my funds are available again. If you bank with Scotiabank you could wake up with no money one day. That is a fact."
1314,SiteJabber,NA,"Horrible customer service. Talked to Kyle and he just rude and not willing to help. Horrible bank, horrible customer service and I do not recommend doing business with them. Horrible experience."
1315,SiteJabber,NA,"Several years ago, I was trying to buy my first home. I knew nothing about mortgage brokers, and my real estate agent had a Scotiabank associate in her office on Parliament St. I was debt-free, holding three part-time jobs, and had a $65,000 as a down payment - this was in 2004, when you could purchase a decent starter house (in Toronto) for about $220,000. I found my dream house, in East York, for $237,000. When I made an offer of $232k, the Scotiabank agent told me that I had obviously NOT read the papers carefully, that I would have to come up with a 35% down payment, approximately $82,500. I tried to see if there was any way I could get around this punitive clause. I was informed that it was because I was a woman, because I was single, and because I didn't have full-time employment - never mind that I was working 28 days a month! I had to settle for a much smaller house in a really trashy area, and it took several moves before I was able to move to a decent area. Thanks a lot, Scotiabank - I would advise against using their services, despite their cheery, misleading advertising."
1316,SiteJabber,NA,"In need of money, rushing to Scotia to take $5000 out. The old bank teller sitting there, we put in right pin, then asked if we have ordered to take cash out. We said no. With other bank, $5000 wouldn't ask to make order first. Then she was asking ID, as my mom old lady only taking Health card with her outside, showing the Health card. Then she asked the phone number, we couldn't remember the full long numbers, instead of asking other verification questions, she went to report to the office. Then it was arguing and questioning like police. It took more than 20 minutes. Even it's duel diligence, questioning as police is not right manner, plus though all our questions answer right. It's so difficult to control voice seeing this kind of so called service. Instead of giving cash $4000 as she said she could do, she lowered it to $3000. After 30 minutes we stepped into the bank, we took $3000 out from the bank. This is not giving service, this is giving trouble.

Wish the old lady good luck in her career, witch acting like a police."

1318,SiteJabber,NA,"Today I called in to deal with an issue I had with my credit card activation.

It was an essentially straight forward issue that an agent should have easily been able to help me with.

The agent I spoke to was completely useless. He was virtually incoherent and didn't listen to me, just kept talking over me from what sounded like a rote script.

At a certain point in the conversation when he told me that he couldn't access my account or help me I hung up the phone and called in again.

On the next call the agent I spoke to was very friendly and helpful and he transferred me to someone else once I explained the issue.

The next agent likewise was great, he quickly resolved the issue and was very personable.

Last week I called in to get some information related to a line of credit. I just needed to know when I could expect the welcome package and process in setting up the account online.

The agent wasn't able to provide me with any information. She put me on hold for a few minutes while she looked into it.
When she came back she really didn't answer any of my questions at all.

I haven't dealt with their customer service very much but it's very inconsistent

My plan moving forward- if within the first couple of minutes it becomes clear that the agent is useless hang up and call back.

There is then a chance that you may actually get one of their good agents who knows what they're doing."
1319,SiteJabber,NA,Scotiabank are Theives. Multiple occasions where my money was taken by Scotiabank without my consent. Have to wait for hours online to get transactions reversed.
1320,SiteJabber,NA,"1. Customer service took forever to pick up. Called many times in past one week, then i will hang up after waiting for 20-30mins cos seriously I cannot waste anymore time everyday just trying to catch their cust service. On the 6th day, I finally got hold of one agent and seriously, I cannot understand what the agent is trying. I've been around with people of different accents & i manage to understand them, but this one is seriously terrible in his communication skills.
2. Due to my frustration with my acct and the agent, i asked for a manager and this person has the worst attitude ever. Shouldnt be working in customer service sector.
3. The next day, i went to my branch to close my acct (which i opened just 2 weeks back) because of this poor customer service. My account is on hold because the two person whom i handed my driver license too to verify my identity the acct i opened online did not do their job. Seriously, two person looked into my acct and failed. And thinking about it, the agent who went into my acct when i ask why i cannot do any transaction in my account did not see this at all. He even tried to blame me by saying that i might be choosing wrong acct.
Seriously, i dont know where Scotia are getting these people."
1321,SiteJabber,NA,"Frankly worthless service. I applied to Scotia Bank for a credit card. I live in St. John's, but I was traveling to Toronto and had time, so I contacted the local branch. The employee said that it is not possible to order from Toronto to St. John's, I should contact the branch in St. John's. I did so on November 19. I waited for the card until January, but it did not come. I turned to the branch where I processed, they told me that they could not help me and that I needed to call the call center. The call center tried to clarify my question for 40 minutes and finally found out that they sent it to Toronto (although it is impossible from St. John's, as the manager told me). They apologized and said they would send it to me finally in St. John's and I would receive it in a week. But I waited two weeks and she did not come. I again turned to the call center, where they told me that no one had sent the card anywhere. They apologized again and said that they would send it to their branch in St. John's. Although earlier they said that it was impossible and I could only get by mail. This is unprofessionalism and double standards. I decided not to take that card, because such a service scares and repels."
1322,SiteJabber,NA,"Tried to send an interac transfer to my SO (who has sent and received money from me before), Scotiabank decides today's the day they're going to block the transfer without offering an explanation or initial check before just blocking it. After talking to multiple chat advisors, nobody could give me an answer and told me ""call this number, they know"" Guess what! A 2 HOUR wait before I spoke to a single person. I had to wait and listen to their awful music, and had to spend almost another hour before it could be resolved. I went to the branch the next day and withdrew my funds, closing my account. What an absolute awful bank and an awful experience. This was the final straw after numerous ""____ service will not be available from M-F"" ""Interac is currently down"" ""There was an error logging you in"" ""Sorry, can't complete the request right now"", not to mention the EXTENDED amount of time you have to wait for refunds, payments to reflect, or anything being processed versus other banks. I encourage everyone to explore their options outside of Scotiabank."
1323,SiteJabber,NA,"I wanted to share my recent banking experience, or should I say, banking liberation!

After enduring endless disappointments with the lack of professionalism from my branch manager and the continuous subpar customer service at Scotiabank, I've finally decided enough is enough.

Enter Wise (formerly TransferWise)! This is the game-changer I've been searching for. Not only do they offer complete banking services, online account management, and physical debit cards, but their lightning-fast international transfers in seconds have me amazed. And the best part? It's a whopping 80% cheaper than what I was paying at Scotiabank!

No more being treated like just another account number. No more exorbitant fees eating away at my hard-earned money. Wise is the modern banking solution I've been dreaming of. So, sayonara, Scotiabank, and hello to a banking partner that actually values my time, money, and satisfaction.

If you're fed up with subpar service and want to save big, give Wise a serious look. Trust me, you won't regret it. #BankingRevolution #WiseChoice"
1324,SiteJabber,NA,"We had a joint account with Scotia Lawrence E branch.We put a stop payment to one of the prepaid transactions and it so happened that the payment went through the first time. The second attempt it didn't go through however I was charged an NSF. I went to the bank and explained my situation. $96 was returned. The third time the same transaction which I put a stop payment to didn't go through 4times and I was charged an NSF of $288. The manager called me on phone and I told him but I put a stop payment to that transaction why do I have to pay and he said "" we cannot help you you have to pay us"" I went to the branch, and the lady who was helping me was like but why would she pay if she put a stop payment, The manager was called and he said I can give you a discount of $50 but you have to pay the rest. I couldn't deal with such an unprofessional so called manager I told him never mind will pay $288 and close the account. I paid the $288 closed the account. That person you put to run your business is going to run it down he is so unprofessional and even when all his colleagues told him what the matter was, he said there is nothing to be done. I am glad I closed it I now do business with better and professional institutions."
1325,SiteJabber,NA,Its almost more than 3hrs of waiting on hold during call. Since its my 3rd time i called and have to wait for more than 3 hours. No body is that much free to wait. I wasted whole day for this call.
1326,SiteJabber,NA,"I banked with Scotia for over 10 years. In all that time, I never had a single advisor attempt to connect with me about my investments or accounts until I finally got fed up with the institution and started closing my accounts. The wait time over the phone is so long you have to take time off work to physically go down to do anything. They force you to pay to close a simple chequing account, and I am now on week 3 of trying to get the contents of my TFSA account transferred and closed. I suddenly have a financial advisor who I have never spoken to before calling me, but when it comes time for our scheduled appointment to have the last of my accounts closed, he can't be bothered to call and I am forced to make another appointment as Scotia won't do anything over the phone. I shouldn't have to beg to have my own money returned to me. The only time this bank cares about their customers is when they aren't making monthly fees off of them. Consider banking with a smaller institution and avoid Scotiabank. They are terrible and will avoid appointments in order to hold on to your money for as long as possible. Incredibly unprofessional."

1331,SiteJabber,NA,"Do not use Scotia Bank! They are a pugnacious institution. I was with this bank from 2001 to 2018 at North Van and Lonsdale Branch. Up until 2017 I was highly satisfied, I had a bank representative that would proactively reach out to renew my mortgage etc.

In 2018 my mortgage came up for renewal. I left a few messages with my new Bank Representative who never returned my calls, had no voice mail, and left a 1 800 number on her message (later found out she was on mat leave but no mention in her phone message). Eventually I contacted their central team and the interest rates offered were very uncompetitive with the market offering at the time. I told the rep that I would be placing my mortgage with another institution.

Unfortunately my new bank did not complete the paper work in time and the mortgage renewed automatically into a 5% 6 month term (highway robbery). Another rep at the branch had sent an email to my old email address about a month before the maturity date and obviously got a bounce back message but never acknowledged. He then left a V. M. on my phone the day before the maturity date indicating he wanted to confirm what type of mortgage to renew too. When I phoned back 2 days later he said it was too late and the mortgage had been rolled over into a 6 month fixed term. I ended up having to pay a $6000 penalty to get out of the mortgage and promptly closed all of my accounts and said goodbye to Scotia. This is how they rewarded me after 17 years of loyalty. Do not use this bank, stay away, they are a malicious, heartless institution and will likely fade in the coming years as it looks as though there are several other disappointed customers out there."
1332,SiteJabber,NA,"DO NOT BANK WITH SCOTIA!
Their employees know zero about banking, they will give you the run around, and if you phone they'll put you on hold endlessly.
Then they will say they will set up what you need in the future, but when you check in later, NOTHING WILL HAVE BEEN DONE! And the whole incompetent run around will start again.
I kid you not, they will put you on hold for hours, trying to figure out how to solve your BASIC(!) REQUEST.
Then if and when you ask for a manager or supervisor, to complain, the run around will just continue, putting you on hold endlessly.

I have tried going to 3 different branches and talked on the phone, with said above process, 3 times.
Now, is it super complicated what I ask?, you wonder. NO!
Just a stop payment.

It would have been, and will be, faster to go to a different bank and open an account there!

DO NOT BANK WITH SCOTIA, THEY ARE A JOKE!
Only time you'll be helped professionally is when you want to bring them (new) business.

1334,SiteJabber,NA,"Realestate lawyers beware of this branch (Yonge and Bullock)- This branch will hold a certified cheque from the sale of you home because the lawyer deposited it. This could potentially hold up your clients purchase of their next home or a transfer to their investment account if they haven't purchased a home yet.

I spent the day on the phone trying to get the hold removed when I got a message that my account was in overdraft. I talked to the manager at this branch and she said they had to hold the cheque because a third party deposited it. Yet my parents home closed the same day and was deposited by their lawyer to a brand new Scotiabank account. No hold on their funds (and it was a much larger cheque). I've been a customer for over three years with no NSF's and a very good credit rating and my funds are held. I was told only my branch manager could remove the hold. I spent the day trying to contact her with no luck. I eventually got the number to the presidents office *******043 and was told it may take up to 15 days to resolve. If you're having problems call this number first as you won't get any help from the branch or the help line.

I contacted my lawyer this morning and he said he uses this branch all the time and the branch manager never holds the certified cheques but all of a sudden they want to hold mine without letting me know.

I'll continue to update this review. Hopefully it won't take 15 days to resolve and that this will not affect my credit rating and incur extra charges from my investment company.

I hope this doesn't happen to other customers when selling their home. I've contacted my lawyer to let him know not to use this branch as well. But to be on the safe side just don't use Scotiabank at all."
1335,SiteJabber,NA,Don't bother expecting them to help the only thing they can seem to do is confirm you ID and move you in circles between departments.

1337,SiteJabber,NA,"As a long-time customer of the Scotiabank, the service has been on a steady decline in the last couple of years. If you have an issue with this bank good luck in getting a resolution and not to mention getting a hold of anyone to return your calls. If you call the Customer Care Center most of the agents are not capable of helping you out but they will make an appointment for you at your bank location which no one ever bothers calling you back. Then you follow their complaint process and, in the end, they (SCOTIABANK)is always right. This was my second issue with them)of not returning my calls) and no one, including my bank has ever called me back to discuss any of this. What are they hiding? The process: contact your bank. I did and I left a message a few weeks ago and thus far no one has bothered to call me back. I then emailed the Office of the President to confirm receipt of email. What do I get? Someone who has rehearsed and memorized a phrase that they continued to repeat that have ""24 hours to acknowledge receipt"" over and over again. This to me felt very condescending. To date, no one has ever contacted me or acknowledged receipt of my emails. I guess they believe they are following policies/procedures and do not need to do anything further. I also sent an email to the Office of the Ombudsman as per their process. They too have not responded. I believe they have 30 days to do so. The process is so lengthy and time consuming that I truly believe they hope one would give up or with time the issue will eventually ""go away"". This arrogance still does not negate the POOR customer Service received or make me feel any better.

Scotiabank, do us a favour and please invest more into your Customer Service! In case you did not know, it is common courtesy to return customer calls! Training employees to say sorry over and over again and having them reiterate a memorized script does not make me feel any better if NOTHING is done! You can do better!

I give you a ZERO for Customer Service. Hope you take these suggestions and do something about them.

When I went online to redeem my promo points one year later, they were no where to be found and after 4 online chats with no help where the points were I was referred to an 800 number and again several attempts to locate the promo points were unsuccessful. I was finally referred to yet another person who said there was a disclosure stating I was to use the card within 30 days to get the promo points. Now this information was never given to me. I feel I was tricked into getting this card with a promise that never exist. On top of the monthly fee, there are additional charges plus a $99 dollar annual fee.

I left it and I went on my vacation to the state and back. Went to the bank again to have my card change. And the process is is rather time consuming and tiring. Took my lunch time from work hoping I would get this done n it was a waste of my lunch time. I turn to the sale rep and I asked isn't there a easier way to just get a replacement card that waiting ere in line her words were "" NO SIR"" I have to go back to work so can u please have them send me a new card in the can I make that request, NO SIR u have to wait. Have number 34 and having a job to return to. You all can do better. Implement SOP. That will better able to facilitate customers. There are ways to assign workers to get the job done in s more effective and efficient manner. Break the work load into specific job roles and the process can be much more effective. Am do turn off. I just transferred my salary from one back because of there service and now I feel I will be doing the same. You all need to fix this. U can't be going to the bank n spending the entire day just to get your business done. It's ridiculous. We are in a competitive market place n ppl have choices. Step up n put plans in place. Am hurt.

They have had all needed information since November 22nd, yet continue to say they don't have the information, and that there is a blackout on the transfer of the RIF. I have searched high and low, and to the best of my knowledge, this is not a real thing. No one, including the person I spoke with at the Office of the President, has ever heard of this. Not the CRA, not anyone at the branch, not other banking professionals... NO ONE. It is not indicated in any documentation from Scotiabank or otherwise. The Voluntary Commitments and Code of Conduct Guidelines for Transfers of Registered Plans indicates that once all needed information is received, banks will endeavour to process transfers of deposit type registered plans in a maximum of seven business days. This couldn't be further from the truth! I am waiting on the transfer of a TFSA and RIF and neither have been processed. So now I have 3 complaints in with Scotiabank and continue to wait on responses, even though I have reached out numerous times, have provided all needed documentation, etc."

I was on the phone put on long waits! Transferred to 5 different people! This took 5 hours! I was told the money would be there in 5 days! Guess what!? Surprise! Not there! I talked to a very nice bank manager that assured me that was rediculous and she was in the fight for me. Finally once again I have to wait up to 3 business days I went in to the bank and I was very upset. Basically had to threaten that I wanted it today or I was leaving! Threaten not in a harmful way let's make that clear. Lol I didnt care how they got the money! Aghh they offered me an over draft... um are you kidding me!? Lol I told them that they could all take it out of there pockets and then get the money and see how they liked it. I then took all my money out of my account and said today and even then I have ro think about coming back.In a half an hour my money was there! Hmm what a surprise! I told them that with all I went through it didnt feel like enough! I had to use my rent money for the summer as I do not work! I told them that I feel I should be reimbursed that money for the upset! The emotional crap I had to go through and how I had to make threats before something happened!. The manager agreed.

1346,SiteJabber,NA,"Despite being a customer for many years, Scotiabank denied my existence because I left town for one year. They turned over all my child's education savings plan to the control of my ex partner, even though it is specified on file to not do so. After showing proof that I was a client, the person who denied that I ever existed as a client was conveniently let go or transferred. Recently, I was sold fraudulent concert tickets and I have tried tonight five times to report this fraud. Once the lady said that I didn't answer my questions correctly, even though I had The app open on my phone so I can answer the questions perfectly. The second time after answering the questions the man put me on hold and after five minutes it just hung up on me. I've called three more times and one time I recorded the entire call, and every time it transfers me to the fraud department to report the fraud, it just hangs up on me. Something very very strange is going on with Scotiabank and I'd like to know what it is. I had to replace my card because it suddenly was not working and they said it's because your tap only has a certain amount for the entire life of the card. They told me that your tap limits run out after a certain amount of taps. Forever and then you have to get a new card which nobody else that I know has had this experience. I went downtown to open a business account as an independent paralegal, and I was treated like garbage. Even as I try to get insurance for my paralegal service company, I am still being treated like absolute trash, all of this, despite finishing as one of the top students in my college class. I'm so sick of the discrimination, and if anybody else would give my black face an account anywhere else, I would leave Scotiabank. I need this fraud reported as soon as possible, and I need anybody involved at Scotiabank to also face legal consequences if that's the case. PS. After more than five years with this bank, I could still only withdraw $100 after depositing at the machine."
1347,SiteJabber,NA,"READ MY REVIEW FOR THE TRUTH
Hours terrible can't ever get to a branch on time after work, they hold your cheques for no good reasons and have ridiculous requirements for customers to meet that other banks don't, not going to get in too much detail.
Trying to reach your local branch or any branch by any means is unable to happen even if you get an extension number they wont even answer or call you back after leaving a message.
Interest rates are usually quite high for credit and debit accounts.
Tellers in branches are very unknowledgeable or rude depending on but most.
A big problem I have is if a transaction is cancled or failed on thier end it'll tell you insufficient funds when that isn't the case at all and takes many days to get your money back.
Scotiabank has very few atms, you can only take out multiples of $20 bills from ATM.
Scotiabank website is down almost every day, and has very few options to choose from resulting in you having to go to the bank yourself for a simple fix.
Theres also very few tellers so you'll be waiting in line for awhile.

1349,SiteJabber,NA,"Do not apply for a Scotia Bank credit card. The bank does not help you when you have any issues with online purchases. I used my card for an online purchase with Walmart. It was a third-party purchase and Walmart and the third party were pointing fingers at each other as to who is responsible for the price match. This item was a cabinet bed and I was concerned that if there was an issue with the bed there would also be finger-pointing, so I decided to return the item. I never opened it. I emailed Walmart and responses were to come within a few days. They never did reply via email. I called customer service and was told they would send me a mailing label so this item could be returned. I never received a mailing label. 3 more calls with promises of a label. By this time my credit card payment was due for this item. I called Scotia Bank and they understood and told me not to pay it. They would put it on hold while they dispute the charge. That changed a number of days later when a different person called back from the resolution department. They told me to return the item and if Walmart then did not give me a refund Scotia Bank could then help me. I explained again that I could not just return the item to a store. It had to be shipped back to the third party. I asked Scotia Bank to help me with a mailing label from Walmart. Scotia Bank said they can not call a company on our behalf. I was willing to sign giving permission, but they just don't do this. This is a long story, but in the end since I did not pay for this item as I wanted it returned, Scotia Bank did not view me as their customer, they sent it off to collections. Nice work! I have never in my life not paid for an item. Never! The customer service with Walmart and Scotia Bank was absolutely unacceptable. The way I was treated by Scotia Bank was also unacceptable. They started harassing me instead of trying to help me. Do not use this bank."

1358,SiteJabber,NA,I had a savings account that I opened cos I quit smoking. 150 dollars every 2 weeks. My circumstances have changed so I wanted to with draw money. I get told I need a licensed banker to do this by Kurtis mader. This man who is supposedly customer experience lead did absolutely nothing for me. An appointment would be several days away or I could use the phone cos there are licensed people on the phone... if I knew that I. Had this kind of account I would've never agreed to it. Kurtis mader brings nothing to the table.the people of Scotia bank pay for this man's wages and all I see him do is go on the computers. He does not help at all in customer service so why are we paying fir his services. Even when it is busy all he does is sit at his desk on the computer. It doesn't seem to matter to Kurtis mader that he sits behind a computer while people wait for 20 min to be serves... on his business card it says that he is a customer experience lead... where is his experience when all we see him do Is sit there and do absolutely nothing... some customer service. We are paying this useless man to do nothing... I wish I had a job like his. I am also in customer service and I tell you I do not treat people this way... I would ask Scotiabank to look into his useless occupation that we are paying for and let him and his customer experience lead to another position since he can't help anyone so what use is he... every time I go into the bank and it's really busy he doesn't get up from his computer to help... wow. Scotiabank really hit the jackpot when you hired this man who does absolutely nothing. Except sit at his computer... and don't tell me that he works at his computer for 8 hourd
1359,SiteJabber,NA,"We have been with this bank for over 20 years. Initially great. Since the change to run everything out of Toronto terrible. The move to the AI monitoring system is also a bust. I just put 30K on a credit line I have with them as a cushion for the upcoming 2023 uncertainty. I log on a couple of days later and they reduced the credit for that account down to 1K from 31K. I have had this credit line and a few others and 3 mortgages and a couple credit cards for the same amount of time. All in the name of business. I don't miss payments and they pull this stunt. This AI monitoring if you are late on a payment 1 day they can double your interest on that credit line for one year. They have done that to me twice. I was in the hospital when that happened this time. AND WE DO A TON OF BUSINESS WITH THEM / INCLUDING STOCKS They are very hard to deal with now. The branches still have some good people but they are just puppets now not financial experts like they once were. Poor customer service no one knows what they are doing OR can't do it because they are not allowed. Errors in billing can't be addressed because no one can help you - then you get sent somewhere else and the don't help you either - using the message center gets you the same thing ""you need to call customer service"" NO WONDER THEIR STOCK HAS BEEN BEATEN UP OVER THE PAST YEAR. We deal with several other banks and are moving everything from scotia - None of them are this. Don't bank there even as a good customer you get treated like a chump. They are in my opinion the worst bank in Canada at the present time. Save yourself the headache."

1362,SiteJabber,NA,"I have my open account with them. When i went to purchase my phone they asked me to call Transunion and verify because something is wrong, i got to know that my bank is not reporting my credits to bureau and my address is not even updated at their end. Millwoods and 91 Street banks are trying to sort this out and making excuses from last 4 months every time i call them they ask me to wait for more 60-90 days. Worst ever bank. Even financial advisor and bank managers can not help me at all. I spoke to Transunion they sent me a letter which never shown up at all. Bank want me to talk to Transunion. Transunion wanted me to talk to My creditors. They always talk about investments, which i do not wanna do... who will deal with the investment? With them they are not REPORTING ANYTHING TO CREDIT BUREAU... WORST BANK EVER NOVASCOTIA :( IT IS VERY STRESSFULL, IF SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO ME IT WILL BE ALL BECAUSE OF SCOTIABANK. They ae just making excuses again and again. Even i sent an email to their president's office as well. Never got any reply back, they just do not card for their customers. When ever i ask for an update they need more months but still not doing anything. They use to talk to me nicely but now its all changed. They do not understand other people's stress."

1h and 30 mins like wtf"
1364,SiteJabber,NA,"My I'd expired during a really stressful move. My wallet got stolen from my broken into car and I needed a new card. I went to the bank and said I was who I am and also gave them alll my documents. They flagged me for possible fraud, froze my lost card and my online banking. And told me to get a new ID prior to getting a new card. I went back and fourth and finally they said there was a way through the paperwork I already showed that they could get it working. They have taken literally all my documents and information (things they really shouldn't have had in the first place) and started copying it…

I feel like

1. I'm a victim of a hate crime,
2. Some of the money is gov security money (illegal)
3. An infringement of my privacy as well.

You say you LGTBQ+ friendly but at the end of the day the group you labeled me in is just another statistic at the end of the gay.

When you change your name you have to send in your birth certificate. They didn't send it back and I really at the time didn't care to much… well in order to get a new ID after it's expired you need a Birth certificate, which you need a bank card to get.

I currently have no choice but to have my finances put in said bank account but I have zero way to access them. I am renting now but literally with everything that's happening, being a dead beat dad, Christmas coming soon as well as rent… if I had a gun I $#*!ing shoot myself rather than deal with the $#*!ty dead beat I'm going to appear to be this Christmas….

I have little to no help in this word and you've financially set me up for failure. We live in Canada, Kelowna right now is-16. Honestly if a parent did this to a child is would be neglected and they would go to jail.

Unfortunately for me I'm nobody and people don't care about no bodies."

1368,SiteJabber,NA,"Do not use Scotia Bank! They are a pugnacious institution. I was with this bank from 2001 to 2018 at North Van and Lonsdale Branch. Up until 2017 I was highly satisfied, I had a bank representative that would proactively reach out to renew my mortgage etc.

In 2018 my mortgage came up for renewal. I left a few messages with my new Bank Representative who never returned my calls, had no voice mail, and left a 1 800 number on her message (later found out she was on mat leave but no mention in her phone message). Eventually I contacted their central team and the interest rates offered were very uncompetitive with the market offering at the time. I told the rep that I would be placing my mortgage with another institution.

Unfortunately my new bank did not complete the paper work in time and the mortgage renewed automatically into a 5% 6 month term (highway robbery). Another rep at the branch had sent an email to my old email address about a month before the maturity date and obviously got a bounce back message but never acknowledged. He then left a V. M. on my phone the day before the maturity date indicating he wanted to confirm what type of mortgage to renew too. When I phoned back 2 days later he said it was too late and the mortgage had been rolled over into a 6 month fixed term. I ended up having to pay a $6000 penalty to get out of the mortgage and promptly closed all of my accounts and said goodbye to Scotia. This is how they rewarded me after 17 years of loyalty. Do not use this bank, stay away, they are a malicious, heartless institution and will likely fade in the coming years as it looks as though there are several other disappointed customers out there."
1369,SiteJabber,NA,"DO NOT BANK WITH SCOTIA!
Their employees know zero about banking, they will give you the run around, and if you phone they'll put you on hold endlessly.
Then they will say they will set up what you need in the future, but when you check in later, NOTHING WILL HAVE BEEN DONE! And the whole incompetent run around will start again.
I kid you not, they will put you on hold for hours, trying to figure out how to solve your BASIC(!) REQUEST.
Then if and when you ask for a manager or supervisor, to complain, the run around will just continue, putting you on hold endlessly.

I have tried going to 3 different branches and talked on the phone, with said above process, 3 times.
Now, is it super complicated what I ask?, you wonder. NO!
Just a stop payment.

It would have been, and will be, faster to go to a different bank and open an account there!

DO NOT BANK WITH SCOTIA, THEY ARE A JOKE!
Only time you'll be helped professionally is when you want to bring them (new) business.

1371,SiteJabber,NA,"Realestate lawyers beware of this branch (Yonge and Bullock)- This branch will hold a certified cheque from the sale of you home because the lawyer deposited it. This could potentially hold up your clients purchase of their next home or a transfer to their investment account if they haven't purchased a home yet.

I spent the day on the phone trying to get the hold removed when I got a message that my account was in overdraft. I talked to the manager at this branch and she said they had to hold the cheque because a third party deposited it. Yet my parents home closed the same day and was deposited by their lawyer to a brand new Scotiabank account. No hold on their funds (and it was a much larger cheque). I've been a customer for over three years with no NSF's and a very good credit rating and my funds are held. I was told only my branch manager could remove the hold. I spent the day trying to contact her with no luck. I eventually got the number to the presidents office *******043 and was told it may take up to 15 days to resolve. If you're having problems call this number first as you won't get any help from the branch or the help line.

I contacted my lawyer this morning and he said he uses this branch all the time and the branch manager never holds the certified cheques but all of a sudden they want to hold mine without letting me know.

I'll continue to update this review. Hopefully it won't take 15 days to resolve and that this will not affect my credit rating and incur extra charges from my investment company.

I hope this doesn't happen to other customers when selling their home. I've contacted my lawyer to let him know not to use this branch as well. But to be on the safe side just don't use Scotiabank at all."
1372,SiteJabber,NA,Don't bother expecting them to help the only thing they can seem to do is confirm you ID and move you in circles between departments.
1373,SiteJabber,NA,"Sooooo Frustrating called several times in a day one the morning one noon time and 3pm. Waited 40 minutes no available representative... Veryyyyy poooor service. March 15, called and March 16,2022."
1374,SiteJabber,NA,"As a long-time customer of the Scotiabank, the service has been on a steady decline in the last couple of years. If you have an issue with this bank good luck in getting a resolution and not to mention getting a hold of anyone to return your calls. If you call the Customer Care Center most of the agents are not capable of helping you out but they will make an appointment for you at your bank location which no one ever bothers calling you back. Then you follow their complaint process and, in the end, they (SCOTIABANK)is always right. This was my second issue with them)of not returning my calls) and no one, including my bank has ever called me back to discuss any of this. What are they hiding? The process: contact your bank. I did and I left a message a few weeks ago and thus far no one has bothered to call me back. I then emailed the Office of the President to confirm receipt of email. What do I get? Someone who has rehearsed and memorized a phrase that they continued to repeat that have ""24 hours to acknowledge receipt"" over and over again. This to me felt very condescending. To date, no one has ever contacted me or acknowledged receipt of my emails. I guess they believe they are following policies/procedures and do not need to do anything further. I also sent an email to the Office of the Ombudsman as per their process. They too have not responded. I believe they have 30 days to do so. The process is so lengthy and time consuming that I truly believe they hope one would give up or with time the issue will eventually ""go away"". This arrogance still does not negate the POOR customer Service received or make me feel any better.

Scotiabank, do us a favour and please invest more into your Customer Service! In case you did not know, it is common courtesy to return customer calls! Training employees to say sorry over and over again and having them reiterate a memorized script does not make me feel any better if NOTHING is done! You can do better!

I give you a ZERO for Customer Service. Hope you take these suggestions and do something about them.

1375,SiteJabber,NA,"I have waisted months trying to get Scotia Rewards to honor what they told me they would. I used my travel rewards card to book a trip for my family, through the Scotia Travel site. My flights were canceled and instead of Scotia sending us a email stating this cancelation they sent an email with no information just a number to call. I then spent 11 days trying to get through to Scotia travel only to be given aditude by the horrible customer service representative. It then took them nearly a month to refund my money and nearly four months to return my points. Now they will not let me use my points for the new flights I had to re book.

First of all the bank at Place d' Orleans in Orleans, Ontario promised me 20,000 promo points with no expiry date. They never mentioned additional monthly charges. When I went online to redeem my promo points one year later, they were no where to be found and after 4 online chats with no help where the points were I was referred to an 800 number and again several attempts to locate the promo points were unsuccessful. I was finally referred to yet another person who said there was a disclosure stating I was to use the card within 30 days to get the promo points. Now this information was never given to me. I feel I was tricked into getting this card with a promise that never exist. On top of the monthly fee, there are additional charges plus a $99 dollar annual fee. I have always paid the bill in full and only received very little points that cannot be redeemed for anything! DON'T APPLY FOR THIS CARD THROUGH SCOTIABANK! It's a bank PROMO SCAM!"
1378,SiteJabber,NA,"Out of 5 it's a ZERO! December 2021 I went to the Browns town branch to have my card change because I was about to travel. I spoke with a representative within the branch. Told her what was my issue and she advised me that my card will be sent out in the already. I have told her that I have been checking and nothing. She kept saying check with your postal agent. I left it and I went on my vacation to the state and back. Went to the bank again to have my card change. And the process is is rather time consuming and tiring. Took my lunch time from work hoping I would get this done n it was a waste of my lunch time. I turn to the sale rep and I asked isn't there a easier way to just get a replacement card that waiting ere in line her words were "" NO SIR"" I have to go back to work so can u please have them send me a new card in the can I make that request, NO SIR u have to wait. Have number 34 and having a job to return to. You all can do better. Implement SOP. That will better able to facilitate customers. There are ways to assign workers to get the job done in s more effective and efficient manner. Break the work load into specific job roles and the process can be much more effective. Am do turn off. I just transferred my salary from one back because of there service and now I feel I will be doing the same. You all need to fix this. U can't be going to the bank n spending the entire day just to get your business done. It's ridiculous. We are in a competitive market place n ppl have choices. Step up n put plans in place. Am hurt. I don't lie. I took time out today to get it done n I wasted my time. Poor service!"
1379,SiteJabber,NA,"I have a complaint in with Scotiabank, and ""coincidentally"" they have yet to process the transfers of registered accounts to another institution. They have had all needed information since November 22nd, yet continue to say they don't have the information, and that there is a blackout on the transfer of the RIF. I have searched high and low, and to the best of my knowledge, this is not a real thing. No one, including the person I spoke with at the Office of the President, has ever heard of this. Not the CRA, not anyone at the branch, not other banking professionals... NO ONE. It is not indicated in any documentation from Scotiabank or otherwise. The Voluntary Commitments and Code of Conduct Guidelines for Transfers of Registered Plans indicates that once all needed information is received, banks will endeavour to process transfers of deposit type registered plans in a maximum of seven business days. This couldn't be further from the truth! I am waiting on the transfer of a TFSA and RIF and neither have been processed. So now I have 3 complaints in with Scotiabank and continue to wait on responses, even though I have reached out numerous times, have provided all needed documentation, etc."

1382,SiteJabber,NA,"At one point I would have give 5 stars! My account was defrauded of a 975$! I was told it would take 9 days! After 10 days noone knew what I was talking about!? I was on the phone put on long waits! Transferred to 5 different people! This took 5 hours! I was told the money would be there in 5 days! Guess what!? Surprise! Not there! I talked to a very nice bank manager that assured me that was rediculous and she was in the fight for me. Finally once again I have to wait up to 3 business days I went in to the bank and I was very upset. Basically had to threaten that I wanted it today or I was leaving! Threaten not in a harmful way let's make that clear. Lol I didnt care how they got the money! Aghh they offered me an over draft... um are you kidding me!? Lol I told them that they could all take it out of there pockets and then get the money and see how they liked it. I then took all my money out of my account and said today and even then I have ro think about coming back.In a half an hour my money was there! Hmm what a surprise! I told them that with all I went through it didnt feel like enough! I had to use my rent money for the summer as I do not work! I told them that I feel I should be reimbursed that money for the upset! The emotional crap I had to go through and how I had to make threats before something happened!. The manager agreed. Hmm passive aggressive maybe. Idk. However I'm sure that wont happen. I also said or dont charge me for a year for using your bank. Lol
I'm sure I wonr hear back. It's too bad I really liked it until then."
1383,SiteJabber,NA,"Despite being a customer for many years, Scotiabank denied my existence because I left town for one year. They turned over all my child's education savings plan to the control of my ex partner, even though it is specified on file to not do so. After showing proof that I was a client, the person who denied that I ever existed as a client was conveniently let go or transferred. Recently, I was sold fraudulent concert tickets and I have tried tonight five times to report this fraud. Once the lady said that I didn't answer my questions correctly, even though I had The app open on my phone so I can answer the questions perfectly. The second time after answering the questions the man put me on hold and after five minutes it just hung up on me. I've called three more times and one time I recorded the entire call, and every time it transfers me to the fraud department to report the fraud, it just hangs up on me. Something very very strange is going on with Scotiabank and I'd like to know what it is. I had to replace my card because it suddenly was not working and they said it's because your tap only has a certain amount for the entire life of the card. They told me that your tap limits run out after a certain amount of taps. Forever and then you have to get a new card which nobody else that I know has had this experience. I went downtown to open a business account as an independent paralegal, and I was treated like garbage. Even as I try to get insurance for my paralegal service company, I am still being treated like absolute trash, all of this, despite finishing as one of the top students in my college class. I'm so sick of the discrimination, and if anybody else would give my black face an account anywhere else, I would leave Scotiabank. I need this fraud reported as soon as possible, and I need anybody involved at Scotiabank to also face legal consequences if that's the case. PS. After more than five years with this bank, I could still only withdraw $100 after depositing at the machine."
1384,SiteJabber,NA,"READ MY REVIEW FOR THE TRUTH
Hours terrible can't ever get to a branch on time after work, they hold your cheques for no good reasons and have ridiculous requirements for customers to meet that other banks don't, not going to get in too much detail.
Trying to reach your local branch or any branch by any means is unable to happen even if you get an extension number they wont even answer or call you back after leaving a message.
Interest rates are usually quite high for credit and debit accounts.
Tellers in branches are very unknowledgeable or rude depending on but most.
A big problem I have is if a transaction is cancled or failed on thier end it'll tell you insufficient funds when that isn't the case at all and takes many days to get your money back.
Scotiabank has very few atms, you can only take out multiples of $20 bills from ATM.
Scotiabank website is down almost every day, and has very few options to choose from resulting in you having to go to the bank yourself for a simple fix.
Theres also very few tellers so you'll be waiting in line for awhile.

1386,SiteJabber,NA,"Do not apply for a Scotia Bank credit card. The bank does not help you when you have any issues with online purchases. I used my card for an online purchase with Walmart. It was a third-party purchase and Walmart and the third party were pointing fingers at each other as to who is responsible for the price match. This item was a cabinet bed and I was concerned that if there was an issue with the bed there would also be finger-pointing, so I decided to return the item. I never opened it. I emailed Walmart and responses were to come within a few days. They never did reply via email. I called customer service and was told they would send me a mailing label so this item could be returned. I never received a mailing label. 3 more calls with promises of a label. By this time my credit card payment was due for this item. I called Scotia Bank and they understood and told me not to pay it. They would put it on hold while they dispute the charge. That changed a number of days later when a different person called back from the resolution department. They told me to return the item and if Walmart then did not give me a refund Scotia Bank could then help me. I explained again that I could not just return the item to a store. It had to be shipped back to the third party. I asked Scotia Bank to help me with a mailing label from Walmart. Scotia Bank said they can not call a company on our behalf. I was willing to sign giving permission, but they just don't do this. This is a long story, but in the end since I did not pay for this item as I wanted it returned, Scotia Bank did not view me as their customer, they sent it off to collections. Nice work! I have never in my life not paid for an item. Never! The customer service with Walmart and Scotia Bank was absolutely unacceptable. The way I was treated by Scotia Bank was also unacceptable. They started harassing me instead of trying to help me. Do not use this bank."

1399,SiteJabber,NA,"I have my open account with them. When i went to purchase my phone they asked me to call Transunion and verify because something is wrong, i got to know that my bank is not reporting my credits to bureau and my address is not even updated at their end. Millwoods and 91 Street banks are trying to sort this out and making excuses from last 4 months every time i call them they ask me to wait for more 60-90 days. Worst ever bank. Even financial advisor and bank managers can not help me at all. I spoke to Transunion they sent me a letter which never shown up at all. Bank want me to talk to Transunion. Transunion wanted me to talk to My creditors. They always talk about investments, which i do not wanna do... who will deal with the investment? With them they are not REPORTING ANYTHING TO CREDIT BUREAU... WORST BANK EVER NOVASCOTIA :( IT IS VERY STRESSFULL, IF SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO ME IT WILL BE ALL BECAUSE OF SCOTIABANK. They ae just making excuses again and again. Even i sent an email to their president's office as well. Never got any reply back, they just do not card for their customers. When ever i ask for an update they need more months but still not doing anything. They use to talk to me nicely but now its all changed. They do not understand other people's stress."

1401,SiteJabber,NA,"My I'd expired during a really stressful move. My wallet got stolen from my broken into car and I needed a new card. I went to the bank and said I was who I am and also gave them alll my documents. They flagged me for possible fraud, froze my lost card and my online banking. And told me to get a new ID prior to getting a new card. I went back and fourth and finally they said there was a way through the paperwork I already showed that they could get it working. They have taken literally all my documents and information (things they really shouldn't have had in the first place) and started copying it…

I feel like

1. I'm a victim of a hate crime,
2. Some of the money is gov security money (illegal)
3. An infringement of my privacy as well.

You say you LGTBQ+ friendly but at the end of the day the group you labeled me in is just another statistic at the end of the gay.

When you change your name you have to send in your birth certificate. They didn't send it back and I really at the time didn't care to much… well in order to get a new ID after it's expired you need a Birth certificate, which you need a bank card to get.

I currently have no choice but to have my finances put in said bank account but I have zero way to access them. I am renting now but literally with everything that's happening, being a dead beat dad, Christmas coming soon as well as rent… if I had a gun I $#*!ing shoot myself rather than deal with the $#*!ty dead beat I'm going to appear to be this Christmas….

I have little to no help in this word and you've financially set me up for failure. We live in Canada, Kelowna right now is-16. Honestly if a parent did this to a child is would be neglected and they would go to jail.

Unfortunately for me I'm nobody and people don't care about no bodies."

1405,SiteJabber,NA,"Do not use Scotia Bank! They are a pugnacious institution. I was with this bank from 2001 to 2018 at North Van and Lonsdale Branch. Up until 2017 I was highly satisfied, I had a bank representative that would proactively reach out to renew my mortgage etc.

In 2018 my mortgage came up for renewal. I left a few messages with my new Bank Representative who never returned my calls, had no voice mail, and left a 1 800 number on her message (later found out she was on mat leave but no mention in her phone message). Eventually I contacted their central team and the interest rates offered were very uncompetitive with the market offering at the time. I told the rep that I would be placing my mortgage with another institution.

Unfortunately my new bank did not complete the paper work in time and the mortgage renewed automatically into a 5% 6 month term (highway robbery). Another rep at the branch had sent an email to my old email address about a month before the maturity date and obviously got a bounce back message but never acknowledged. He then left a V. M. on my phone the day before the maturity date indicating he wanted to confirm what type of mortgage to renew too. When I phoned back 2 days later he said it was too late and the mortgage had been rolled over into a 6 month fixed term. I ended up having to pay a $6000 penalty to get out of the mortgage and promptly closed all of my accounts and said goodbye to Scotia. This is how they rewarded me after 17 years of loyalty. Do not use this bank, stay away, they are a malicious, heartless institution and will likely fade in the coming years as it looks as though there are several other disappointed customers out there."
1406,SiteJabber,NA,"DO NOT BANK WITH SCOTIA!
Their employees know zero about banking, they will give you the run around, and if you phone they'll put you on hold endlessly.
Then they will say they will set up what you need in the future, but when you check in later, NOTHING WILL HAVE BEEN DONE! And the whole incompetent run around will start again.
I kid you not, they will put you on hold for hours, trying to figure out how to solve your BASIC(!) REQUEST.
Then if and when you ask for a manager or supervisor, to complain, the run around will just continue, putting you on hold endlessly.

I have tried going to 3 different branches and talked on the phone, with said above process, 3 times.
Now, is it super complicated what I ask?, you wonder. NO!
Just a stop payment.

It would have been, and will be, faster to go to a different bank and open an account there!

DO NOT BANK WITH SCOTIA, THEY ARE A JOKE!
Only time you'll be helped professionally is when you want to bring them (new) business.

1408,SiteJabber,NA,"Realestate lawyers beware of this branch (Yonge and Bullock)- This branch will hold a certified cheque from the sale of you home because the lawyer deposited it. This could potentially hold up your clients purchase of their next home or a transfer to their investment account if they haven't purchased a home yet.

I spent the day on the phone trying to get the hold removed when I got a message that my account was in overdraft. I talked to the manager at this branch and she said they had to hold the cheque because a third party deposited it. Yet my parents home closed the same day and was deposited by their lawyer to a brand new Scotiabank account. No hold on their funds (and it was a much larger cheque). I've been a customer for over three years with no NSF's and a very good credit rating and my funds are held. I was told only my branch manager could remove the hold. I spent the day trying to contact her with no luck. I eventually got the number to the presidents office *******043 and was told it may take up to 15 days to resolve. If you're having problems call this number first as you won't get any help from the branch or the help line.

I contacted my lawyer this morning and he said he uses this branch all the time and the branch manager never holds the certified cheques but all of a sudden they want to hold mine without letting me know.

I'll continue to update this review. Hopefully it won't take 15 days to resolve and that this will not affect my credit rating and incur extra charges from my investment company.

I hope this doesn't happen to other customers when selling their home. I've contacted my lawyer to let him know not to use this branch as well. But to be on the safe side just don't use Scotiabank at all."

1411,SiteJabber,NA,"As a long-time customer of the Scotiabank, the service has been on a steady decline in the last couple of years. If you have an issue with this bank good luck in getting a resolution and not to mention getting a hold of anyone to return your calls. If you call the Customer Care Center most of the agents are not capable of helping you out but they will make an appointment for you at your bank location which no one ever bothers calling you back. Then you follow their complaint process and, in the end, they (SCOTIABANK)is always right. This was my second issue with them)of not returning my calls) and no one, including my bank has ever called me back to discuss any of this. What are they hiding? The process: contact your bank. I did and I left a message a few weeks ago and thus far no one has bothered to call me back. I then emailed the Office of the President to confirm receipt of email. What do I get? Someone who has rehearsed and memorized a phrase that they continued to repeat that have ""24 hours to acknowledge receipt"" over and over again. This to me felt very condescending. To date, no one has ever contacted me or acknowledged receipt of my emails. I guess they believe they are following policies/procedures and do not need to do anything further. I also sent an email to the Office of the Ombudsman as per their process. They too have not responded. I believe they have 30 days to do so. The process is so lengthy and time consuming that I truly believe they hope one would give up or with time the issue will eventually ""go away"". This arrogance still does not negate the POOR customer Service received or make me feel any better.

Scotiabank, do us a favour and please invest more into your Customer Service! In case you did not know, it is common courtesy to return customer calls! Training employees to say sorry over and over again and having them reiterate a memorized script does not make me feel any better if NOTHING is done! You can do better!

I give you a ZERO for Customer Service. Hope you take these suggestions and do something about them.

My flights were canceled and instead of Scotia sending us a email stating this cancelation they sent an email with no information just a number to call. I then spent 11 days trying to get through to Scotia travel only to be given aditude by the horrible customer service representative. It then took them nearly a month to refund my money and nearly four months to return my points. Now they will not let me use my points for the new flights I had to re book.

First of all the bank at Place d' Orleans in Orleans, Ontario promised me 20,000 promo points with no expiry date. They never mentioned additional monthly charges. When I went online to redeem my promo points one year later, they were no where to be found and after 4 online chats with no help where the points were I was referred to an 800 number and again several attempts to locate the promo points were unsuccessful. I was finally referred to yet another person who said there was a disclosure stating I was to use the card within 30 days to get the promo points. Now this information was never given to me. I feel I was tricked into getting this card with a promise that never exist. On top of the monthly fee, there are additional charges plus a $99 dollar annual fee. I have always paid the bill in full and only received very little points that cannot be redeemed for anything! DON'T APPLY FOR THIS CARD THROUGH SCOTIABANK! It's a bank PROMO SCAM!"

I left it and I went on my vacation to the state and back. Went to the bank again to have my card change. And the process is is rather time consuming and tiring. Took my lunch time from work hoping I would get this done n it was a waste of my lunch time. I turn to the sale rep and I asked isn't there a easier way to just get a replacement card that waiting ere in line her words were "" NO SIR"" I have to go back to work so can u please have them send me a new card in the can I make that request, NO SIR u have to wait. Have number 34 and having a job to return to. You all can do better. Implement SOP. That will better able to facilitate customers. There are ways to assign workers to get the job done in s more effective and efficient manner. Break the work load into specific job roles and the process can be much more effective. Am do turn off. I just transferred my salary from one back because of there service and now I feel I will be doing the same. You all need to fix this. U can't be going to the bank n spending the entire day just to get your business done. It's ridiculous. We are in a competitive market place n ppl have choices. Step up n put plans in place. Am hurt. I don't lie. I took time out today to get it done n I wasted my time. Poor service!"
1416,SiteJabber,NA,"I have a complaint in with Scotiabank, and ""coincidentally"" they have yet to process the transfers of registered accounts to another institution. They have had all needed information since November 22nd, yet continue to say they don't have the information, and that there is a blackout on the transfer of the RIF. I have searched high and low, and to the best of my knowledge, this is not a real thing. No one, including the person I spoke with at the Office of the President, has ever heard of this. Not the CRA, not anyone at the branch, not other banking professionals... NO ONE. It is not indicated in any documentation from Scotiabank or otherwise. The Voluntary Commitments and Code of Conduct Guidelines for Transfers of Registered Plans indicates that once all needed information is received, banks will endeavour to process transfers of deposit type registered plans in a maximum of seven business days. This couldn't be further from the truth! I am waiting on the transfer of a TFSA and RIF and neither have been processed. So now I have 3 complaints in with Scotiabank and continue to wait on responses, even though I have reached out numerous times, have provided all needed documentation, etc."

1419,SiteJabber,NA,"At one point I would have give 5 stars! My account was defrauded of a 975$! I was told it would take 9 days! After 10 days noone knew what I was talking about!? I was on the phone put on long waits! Transferred to 5 different people! This took 5 hours! I was told the money would be there in 5 days! Guess what!? Surprise! Not there! I talked to a very nice bank manager that assured me that was rediculous and she was in the fight for me. Finally once again I have to wait up to 3 business days I went in to the bank and I was very upset. Basically had to threaten that I wanted it today or I was leaving! Threaten not in a harmful way let's make that clear. Lol I didnt care how they got the money! Aghh they offered me an over draft... um are you kidding me!? Lol I told them that they could all take it out of there pockets and then get the money and see how they liked it. I then took all my money out of my account and said today and even then I have ro think about coming back.In a half an hour my money was there! Hmm what a surprise! I told them that with all I went through it didnt feel like enough! I had to use my rent money for the summer as I do not work! I told them that I feel I should be reimbursed that money for the upset! The emotional crap I had to go through and how I had to make threats before something happened!. The manager agreed. Hmm passive aggressive maybe. Idk. However I'm sure that wont happen. I also said or dont charge me for a year for using your bank. Lol
I'm sure I wonr hear back. It's too bad I really liked it until then."
1420,SiteJabber,NA,"Despite being a customer for many years, Scotiabank denied my existence because I left town for one year. They turned over all my child's education savings plan to the control of my ex partner, even though it is specified on file to not do so. After showing proof that I was a client, the person who denied that I ever existed as a client was conveniently let go or transferred. Recently, I was sold fraudulent concert tickets and I have tried tonight five times to report this fraud. Once the lady said that I didn't answer my questions correctly, even though I had The app open on my phone so I can answer the questions perfectly. The second time after answering the questions the man put me on hold and after five minutes it just hung up on me. I've called three more times and one time I recorded the entire call, and every time it transfers me to the fraud department to report the fraud, it just hangs up on me. Something very very strange is going on with Scotiabank and I'd like to know what it is. I had to replace my card because it suddenly was not working and they said it's because your tap only has a certain amount for the entire life of the card. They told me that your tap limits run out after a certain amount of taps. Forever and then you have to get a new card which nobody else that I know has had this experience. I went downtown to open a business account as an independent paralegal, and I was treated like garbage. Even as I try to get insurance for my paralegal service company, I am still being treated like absolute trash, all of this, despite finishing as one of the top students in my college class. I'm so sick of the discrimination, and if anybody else would give my black face an account anywhere else, I would leave Scotiabank. I need this fraud reported as soon as possible, and I need anybody involved at Scotiabank to also face legal consequences if that's the case. PS. After more than five years with this bank, I could still only withdraw $100 after depositing at the machine."
1421,SiteJabber,NA,"READ MY REVIEW FOR THE TRUTH
Hours terrible can't ever get to a branch on time after work, they hold your cheques for no good reasons and have ridiculous requirements for customers to meet that other banks don't, not going to get in too much detail.
Trying to reach your local branch or any branch by any means is unable to happen even if you get an extension number they wont even answer or call you back after leaving a message.
Interest rates are usually quite high for credit and debit accounts.
Tellers in branches are very unknowledgeable or rude depending on but most.
A big problem I have is if a transaction is cancled or failed on thier end it'll tell you insufficient funds when that isn't the case at all and takes many days to get your money back.
Scotiabank has very few atms, you can only take out multiples of $20 bills from ATM.
Scotiabank website is down almost every day, and has very few options to choose from resulting in you having to go to the bank yourself for a simple fix.
Theres also very few tellers so you'll be waiting in line for awhile.

1423,SiteJabber,NA,"Do not apply for a Scotia Bank credit card. The bank does not help you when you have any issues with online purchases. I used my card for an online purchase with Walmart. It was a third-party purchase and Walmart and the third party were pointing fingers at each other as to who is responsible for the price match. This item was a cabinet bed and I was concerned that if there was an issue with the bed there would also be finger-pointing, so I decided to return the item. I never opened it. I emailed Walmart and responses were to come within a few days. They never did reply via email. I called customer service and was told they would send me a mailing label so this item could be returned. I never received a mailing label. 3 more calls with promises of a label. By this time my credit card payment was due for this item. I called Scotia Bank and they understood and told me not to pay it. They would put it on hold while they dispute the charge. That changed a number of days later when a different person called back from the resolution department. They told me to return the item and if Walmart then did not give me a refund Scotia Bank could then help me. I explained again that I could not just return the item to a store. It had to be shipped back to the third party. I asked Scotia Bank to help me with a mailing label from Walmart. Scotia Bank said they can not call a company on our behalf. I was willing to sign giving permission, but they just don't do this. This is a long story, but in the end since I did not pay for this item as I wanted it returned, Scotia Bank did not view me as their customer, they sent it off to collections. Nice work! I have never in my life not paid for an item. Never! The customer service with Walmart and Scotia Bank was absolutely unacceptable. The way I was treated by Scotia Bank was also unacceptable. They started harassing me instead of trying to help me. Do not use this bank."

Kurtis mader brings nothing to the table.the people of Scotia bank pay for this man's wages and all I see him do is go on the computers. He does not help at all in customer service so why are we paying fir his services. Even when it is busy all he does is sit at his desk on the computer. It doesn't seem to matter to Kurtis mader that he sits behind a computer while people wait for 20 min to be serves... on his business card it says that he is a customer experience lead... where is his experience when all we see him do Is sit there and do absolutely nothing... some customer service. We are paying this useless man to do nothing... I wish I had a job like his. I am also in customer service and I tell you I do not treat people this way... I would ask Scotiabank to look into his useless occupation that we are paying for and let him and his customer experience lead to another position since he can't help anyone so what use is he... every time I go into the bank and it's really busy he doesn't get up from his computer to help... wow.

1433,SiteJabber,NA,"We have been with this bank for over 20 years. Initially great. Since the change to run everything out of Toronto terrible. The move to the AI monitoring system is also a bust. I just put 30K on a credit line I have with them as a cushion for the upcoming 2023 uncertainty. I log on a couple of days later and they reduced the credit for that account down to 1K from 31K. I have had this credit line and a few others and 3 mortgages and a couple credit cards for the same amount of time. All in the name of business. I don't miss payments and they pull this stunt. This AI monitoring if you are late on a payment 1 day they can double your interest on that credit line for one year. They have done that to me twice. I was in the hospital when that happened this time. AND WE DO A TON OF BUSINESS WITH THEM / INCLUDING STOCKS They are very hard to deal with now. The branches still have some good people but they are just puppets now not financial experts like they once were. Poor customer service no one knows what they are doing OR can't do it because they are not allowed. Errors in billing can't be addressed because no one can help you - then you get sent somewhere else and the don't help you either - using the message center gets you the same thing ""you need to call customer service"" NO WONDER THEIR STOCK HAS BEEN BEATEN UP OVER THE PAST YEAR. We deal with several other banks and are moving everything from scotia - None of them are this. Don't bank there even as a good customer you get treated like a chump.

1442,SiteJabber,NA,"Do not use Scotia Bank! They are a pugnacious institution. I was with this bank from 2001 to 2018 at North Van and Lonsdale Branch. Up until 2017 I was highly satisfied, I had a bank representative that would proactively reach out to renew my mortgage etc.

In 2018 my mortgage came up for renewal. I left a few messages with my new Bank Representative who never returned my calls, had no voice mail, and left a 1 800 number on her message (later found out she was on mat leave but no mention in her phone message). Eventually I contacted their central team and the interest rates offered were very uncompetitive with the market offering at the time. I told the rep that I would be placing my mortgage with another institution.

Unfortunately my new bank did not complete the paper work in time and the mortgage renewed automatically into a 5% 6 month term (highway robbery). Another rep at the branch had sent an email to my old email address about a month before the maturity date and obviously got a bounce back message but never acknowledged. He then left a V. M. on my phone the day before the maturity date indicating he wanted to confirm what type of mortgage to renew too. When I phoned back 2 days later he said it was too late and the mortgage had been rolled over into a 6 month fixed term. I ended up having to pay a $6000 penalty to get out of the mortgage and promptly closed all of my accounts and said goodbye to Scotia. This is how they rewarded me after 17 years of loyalty. Do not use this bank, stay away, they are a malicious, heartless institution and will likely fade in the coming years as it looks as though there are several other disappointed customers out there."
1443,SiteJabber,NA,"DO NOT BANK WITH SCOTIA!
Their employees know zero about banking, they will give you the run around, and if you phone they'll put you on hold endlessly.
Then they will say they will set up what you need in the future, but when you check in later, NOTHING WILL HAVE BEEN DONE! And the whole incompetent run around will start again.
I kid you not, they will put you on hold for hours, trying to figure out how to solve your BASIC(!) REQUEST.
Then if and when you ask for a manager or supervisor, to complain, the run around will just continue, putting you on hold endlessly.

I have tried going to 3 different branches and talked on the phone, with said above process, 3 times.
Now, is it super complicated what I ask?, you wonder. NO!
Just a stop payment.

It would have been, and will be, faster to go to a different bank and open an account there!

DO NOT BANK WITH SCOTIA, THEY ARE A JOKE!
Only time you'll be helped professionally is when you want to bring them (new) business.

1445,SiteJabber,NA,"Realestate lawyers beware of this branch (Yonge and Bullock)- This branch will hold a certified cheque from the sale of you home because the lawyer deposited it. This could potentially hold up your clients purchase of their next home or a transfer to their investment account if they haven't purchased a home yet.

I spent the day on the phone trying to get the hold removed when I got a message that my account was in overdraft. I talked to the manager at this branch and she said they had to hold the cheque because a third party deposited it. Yet my parents home closed the same day and was deposited by their lawyer to a brand new Scotiabank account. No hold on their funds (and it was a much larger cheque). I've been a customer for over three years with no NSF's and a very good credit rating and my funds are held. I was told only my branch manager could remove the hold. I spent the day trying to contact her with no luck. I eventually got the number to the presidents office *******043 and was told it may take up to 15 days to resolve. If you're having problems call this number first as you won't get any help from the branch or the help line.

I contacted my lawyer this morning and he said he uses this branch all the time and the branch manager never holds the certified cheques but all of a sudden they want to hold mine without letting me know.

I'll continue to update this review. Hopefully it won't take 15 days to resolve and that this will not affect my credit rating and incur extra charges from my investment company.

I hope this doesn't happen to other customers when selling their home. I've contacted my lawyer to let him know not to use this branch as well. But to be on the safe side just don't use Scotiabank at all."
1446,SiteJabber,NA,Don't bother expecting them to help the only thing they can seem to do is confirm you ID and move you in circles between departments.
1447,SiteJabber,NA,"Sooooo Frustrating called several times in a day one the morning one noon time and 3pm. Waited 40 minutes no available representative... Veryyyyy poooor service. March 15, called and March 16,2022."
1448,SiteJabber,NA,"As a long-time customer of the Scotiabank, the service has been on a steady decline in the last couple of years. If you have an issue with this bank good luck in getting a resolution and not to mention getting a hold of anyone to return your calls. If you call the Customer Care Center most of the agents are not capable of helping you out but they will make an appointment for you at your bank location which no one ever bothers calling you back. Then you follow their complaint process and, in the end, they (SCOTIABANK)is always right. This was my second issue with them)of not returning my calls) and no one, including my bank has ever called me back to discuss any of this. What are they hiding? The process: contact your bank. I did and I left a message a few weeks ago and thus far no one has bothered to call me back. I then emailed the Office of the President to confirm receipt of email. What do I get? Someone who has rehearsed and memorized a phrase that they continued to repeat that have ""24 hours to acknowledge receipt"" over and over again. This to me felt very condescending. To date, no one has ever contacted me or acknowledged receipt of my emails. I guess they believe they are following policies/procedures and do not need to do anything further. I also sent an email to the Office of the Ombudsman as per their process. They too have not responded. I believe they have 30 days to do so. The process is so lengthy and time consuming that I truly believe they hope one would give up or with time the issue will eventually ""go away"". This arrogance still does not negate the POOR customer Service received or make me feel any better.

Scotiabank, do us a favour and please invest more into your Customer Service! In case you did not know, it is common courtesy to return customer calls! Training employees to say sorry over and over again and having them reiterate a memorized script does not make me feel any better if NOTHING is done! You can do better!

I give you a ZERO for Customer Service. Hope you take these suggestions and do something about them.

1449,SiteJabber,NA,"I have waisted months trying to get Scotia Rewards to honor what they told me they would. I used my travel rewards card to book a trip for my family, through the Scotia Travel site. My flights were canceled and instead of Scotia sending us a email stating this cancelation they sent an email with no information just a number to call. I then spent 11 days trying to get through to Scotia travel only to be given aditude by the horrible customer service representative. It then took them nearly a month to refund my money and nearly four months to return my points. Now they will not let me use my points for the new flights I had to re book. Please DO NOT WASTE YOUT TIME WITH THIS BANK!"

1451,SiteJabber,NA,"Scotia Bank American Express Gold card is the WORST card I have ever had! First of all the bank at Place d' Orleans in Orleans, Ontario promised me 20,000 promo points with no expiry date. They never mentioned additional monthly charges. When I went online to redeem my promo points one year later, they were no where to be found and after 4 online chats with no help where the points were I was referred to an 800 number and again several attempts to locate the promo points were unsuccessful. I was finally referred to yet another person who said there was a disclosure stating I was to use the card within 30 days to get the promo points. Now this information was never given to me. I feel I was tricked into getting this card with a promise that never exist. On top of the monthly fee, there are additional charges plus a $99 dollar annual fee. I have always paid the bill in full and only received very little points that cannot be redeemed for anything! DON'T APPLY FOR THIS CARD THROUGH SCOTIABANK! It's a bank PROMO SCAM!"
1452,SiteJabber,NA,"Out of 5 it's a ZERO! December 2021 I went to the Browns town branch to have my card change because I was about to travel. I spoke with a representative within the branch. Told her what was my issue and she advised me that my card will be sent out in the already. I have told her that I have been checking and nothing. She kept saying check with your postal agent. I left it and I went on my vacation to the state and back. Went to the bank again to have my card change. And the process is is rather time consuming and tiring. Took my lunch time from work hoping I would get this done n it was a waste of my lunch time. I turn to the sale rep and I asked isn't there a easier way to just get a replacement card that waiting ere in line her words were "" NO SIR"" I have to go back to work so can u please have them send me a new card in the can I make that request, NO SIR u have to wait. Have number 34 and having a job to return to. You all can do better. Implement SOP. That will better able to facilitate customers. There are ways to assign workers to get the job done in s more effective and efficient manner. Break the work load into specific job roles and the process can be much more effective. Am do turn off. I just transferred my salary from one back because of there service and now I feel I will be doing the same. You all need to fix this. U can't be going to the bank n spending the entire day just to get your business done. It's ridiculous. We are in a competitive market place n ppl have choices. Step up n put plans in place. Am hurt. I don't lie. I took time out today to get it done n I wasted my time. Poor service!"
1453,SiteJabber,NA,"I have a complaint in with Scotiabank, and ""coincidentally"" they have yet to process the transfers of registered accounts to another institution. They have had all needed information since November 22nd, yet continue to say they don't have the information, and that there is a blackout on the transfer of the RIF. I have searched high and low, and to the best of my knowledge, this is not a real thing. No one, including the person I spoke with at the Office of the President, has ever heard of this. Not the CRA, not anyone at the branch, not other banking professionals... NO ONE. It is not indicated in any documentation from Scotiabank or otherwise. The Voluntary Commitments and Code of Conduct Guidelines for Transfers of Registered Plans indicates that once all needed information is received, banks will endeavour to process transfers of deposit type registered plans in a maximum of seven business days. This couldn't be further from the truth! I am waiting on the transfer of a TFSA and RIF and neither have been processed. So now I have 3 complaints in with Scotiabank and continue to wait on responses, even though I have reached out numerous times, have provided all needed documentation, etc."
1454,SiteJabber,NA,June from Lethbridge branch is amazing and fully understood our situation God bless you June thank you so much
1455,SiteJabber,NA,How do you like waiting on hold for 30 min each time you need to talk to a representative? Or just all-around unreliable and subpar services?
1456,SiteJabber,NA,"At one point I would have give 5 stars! My account was defrauded of a 975$! I was told it would take 9 days! After 10 days noone knew what I was talking about!? I was on the phone put on long waits! Transferred to 5 different people! This took 5 hours! I was told the money would be there in 5 days! Guess what!? Surprise! Not there! I talked to a very nice bank manager that assured me that was rediculous and she was in the fight for me. Finally once again I have to wait up to 3 business days I went in to the bank and I was very upset. Basically had to threaten that I wanted it today or I was leaving! Threaten not in a harmful way let's make that clear. Lol I didnt care how they got the money! Aghh they offered me an over draft... um are you kidding me!? Lol I told them that they could all take it out of there pockets and then get the money and see how they liked it. I then took all my money out of my account and said today and even then I have ro think about coming back.In a half an hour my money was there! Hmm what a surprise! I told them that with all I went through it didnt feel like enough! I had to use my rent money for the summer as I do not work! I told them that I feel I should be reimbursed that money for the upset! The emotional crap I had to go through and how I had to make threats before something happened!. The manager agreed. Hmm passive aggressive maybe. Idk. However I'm sure that wont happen. I also said or dont charge me for a year for using your bank. Lol
I'm sure I wonr hear back. It's too bad I really liked it until then."
1457,SiteJabber,NA,"Despite being a customer for many years, Scotiabank denied my existence because I left town for one year. They turned over all my child's education savings plan to the control of my ex partner, even though it is specified on file to not do so. After showing proof that I was a client, the person who denied that I ever existed as a client was conveniently let go or transferred. Recently, I was sold fraudulent concert tickets and I have tried tonight five times to report this fraud. Once the lady said that I didn't answer my questions correctly, even though I had The app open on my phone so I can answer the questions perfectly. The second time after answering the questions the man put me on hold and after five minutes it just hung up on me. I've called three more times and one time I recorded the entire call, and every time it transfers me to the fraud department to report the fraud, it just hangs up on me. Something very very strange is going on with Scotiabank and I'd like to know what it is. I had to replace my card because it suddenly was not working and they said it's because your tap only has a certain amount for the entire life of the card. They told me that your tap limits run out after a certain amount of taps. Forever and then you have to get a new card which nobody else that I know has had this experience. I went downtown to open a business account as an independent paralegal, and I was treated like garbage. Even as I try to get insurance for my paralegal service company, I am still being treated like absolute trash, all of this, despite finishing as one of the top students in my college class. I'm so sick of the discrimination, and if anybody else would give my black face an account anywhere else, I would leave Scotiabank. I need this fraud reported as soon as possible, and I need anybody involved at Scotiabank to also face legal consequences if that's the case. PS. After more than five years with this bank, I could still only withdraw $100 after depositing at the machine."
1458,SiteJabber,NA,"READ MY REVIEW FOR THE TRUTH
Hours terrible can't ever get to a branch on time after work, they hold your cheques for no good reasons and have ridiculous requirements for customers to meet that other banks don't, not going to get in too much detail.
Trying to reach your local branch or any branch by any means is unable to happen even if you get an extension number they wont even answer or call you back after leaving a message.
Interest rates are usually quite high for credit and debit accounts.
Tellers in branches are very unknowledgeable or rude depending on but most.
A big problem I have is if a transaction is cancled or failed on thier end it'll tell you insufficient funds when that isn't the case at all and takes many days to get your money back.
Scotiabank has very few atms, you can only take out multiples of $20 bills from ATM.
Scotiabank website is down almost every day, and has very few options to choose from resulting in you having to go to the bank yourself for a simple fix.
Theres also very few tellers so you'll be waiting in line for awhile.
CHOOSE ANOTHER BANK"

1460,SiteJabber,NA,"Do not apply for a Scotia Bank credit card. The bank does not help you when you have any issues with online purchases. I used my card for an online purchase with Walmart. It was a third-party purchase and Walmart and the third party were pointing fingers at each other as to who is responsible for the price match. This item was a cabinet bed and I was concerned that if there was an issue with the bed there would also be finger-pointing, so I decided to return the item. I never opened it. I emailed Walmart and responses were to come within a few days. They never did reply via email. I called customer service and was told they would send me a mailing label so this item could be returned. I never received a mailing label. 3 more calls with promises of a label. By this time my credit card payment was due for this item. I called Scotia Bank and they understood and told me not to pay it. They would put it on hold while they dispute the charge. That changed a number of days later when a different person called back from the resolution department. They told me to return the item and if Walmart then did not give me a refund Scotia Bank could then help me. I explained again that I could not just return the item to a store. It had to be shipped back to the third party. I asked Scotia Bank to help me with a mailing label from Walmart. Scotia Bank said they can not call a company on our behalf. I was willing to sign giving permission, but they just don't do this. This is a long story, but in the end since I did not pay for this item as I wanted it returned, Scotia Bank did not view me as their customer, they sent it off to collections. Nice work! I have never in my life not paid for an item. Never! The customer service with Walmart and Scotia Bank was absolutely unacceptable. The way I was treated by Scotia Bank was also unacceptable. They started harassing me instead of trying to help me. Do not use this bank."

I do mot wanna smile with him and also told him he has a short memory to which he assured me he didn't. The next thing that comes out of his mouth was "" you don't have to do business here you can go somewhere else"" I said ""make me"" his next reply was "" yes I can because I am the bank manager"" now I did not raise my voice nor was I an irate customer so why would this branch manger literally bully me to smile. That is odd that a manager to whom you already had a horrible experience with be literally be bullying me to smile. All I wanted to do is exactly what I went into the bank to do and leave like I ALWAYS do not expecting I would be bullied and harassed by a bank manager to smile. WOW!

An appointment would be several days away or I could use the phone cos there are licensed people on the phone... if I knew that I. Had this kind of account I would've never agreed to it. Kurtis mader brings nothing to the table.the people of Scotia bank pay for this man's wages and all I see him do is go on the computers. He does not help at all in customer service so why are we paying fir his services. Even when it is busy all he does is sit at his desk on the computer. It doesn't seem to matter to Kurtis mader that he sits behind a computer while people wait for 20 min to be serves... on his business card it says that he is a customer experience lead... where is his experience when all we see him do Is sit there and do absolutely nothing... some customer service. We are paying this useless man to do nothing... I wish I had a job like his. I am also in customer service and I tell you I do not treat people this way... I would ask Scotiabank to look into his useless occupation that we are paying for and let him and his customer experience lead to another position since he can't help anyone so what use is he... every time I go into the bank and it's really busy he doesn't get up from his computer to help... wow. Scotiabank really hit the jackpot when you hired this man who does absolutely nothing. Except sit at his computer... and don't tell me that he works at his computer for 8 hourd
1470,SiteJabber,NA,"We have been with this bank for over 20 years. Initially great. Since the change to run everything out of Toronto terrible. The move to the AI monitoring system is also a bust. I just put 30K on a credit line I have with them as a cushion for the upcoming 2023 uncertainty. I log on a couple of days later and they reduced the credit for that account down to 1K from 31K. I have had this credit line and a few others and 3 mortgages and a couple credit cards for the same amount of time. All in the name of business. I don't miss payments and they pull this stunt. This AI monitoring if you are late on a payment 1 day they can double your interest on that credit line for one year. They have done that to me twice. I was in the hospital when that happened this time. AND WE DO A TON OF BUSINESS WITH THEM / INCLUDING STOCKS They are very hard to deal with now. The branches still have some good people but they are just puppets now not financial experts like they once were. Poor customer service no one knows what they are doing OR can't do it because they are not allowed. Errors in billing can't be addressed because no one can help you - then you get sent somewhere else and the don't help you either - using the message center gets you the same thing ""you need to call customer service"" NO WONDER THEIR STOCK HAS BEEN BEATEN UP OVER THE PAST YEAR. We deal with several other banks and are moving everything from scotia - None of them are this. Don't bank there even as a good customer you get treated like a chump.

I went to the bank and said I was who I am and also gave them alll my documents. They flagged me for possible fraud, froze my lost card and my online banking. And told me to get a new ID prior to getting a new card. I went back and fourth and finally they said there was a way through the paperwork I already showed that they could get it working. They have taken literally all my documents and information (things they really shouldn't have had in the first place) and started copying it…

I feel like

1. I'm a victim of a hate crime,
2. Some of the money is gov security money (illegal)
3. An infringement of my privacy as well.

You say you LGTBQ+ friendly but at the end of the day the group you labeled me in is just another statistic at the end of the gay.

When you change your name you have to send in your birth certificate. They didn't send it back and I really at the time didn't care to much… well in order to get a new ID after it's expired you need a Birth certificate, which you need a bank card to get.

I currently have no choice but to have my finances put in said bank account but I have zero way to access them. I am renting now but literally with everything that's happening, being a dead beat dad, Christmas coming soon as well as rent… if I had a gun I $#*!ing shoot myself rather than deal with the $#*!ty dead beat I'm going to appear to be this Christmas….

In 2018 my mortgage came up for renewal. I left a few messages with my new Bank Representative who never returned my calls, had no voice mail, and left a 1 800 number on her message (later found out she was on mat leave but no mention in her phone message). Eventually I contacted their central team and the interest rates offered were very uncompetitive with the market offering at the time. I told the rep that I would be placing my mortgage with another institution.

Unfortunately my new bank did not complete the paper work in time and the mortgage renewed automatically into a 5% 6 month term (highway robbery). Another rep at the branch had sent an email to my old email address about a month before the maturity date and obviously got a bounce back message but never acknowledged. He then left a V. M. on my phone the day before the maturity date indicating he wanted to confirm what type of mortgage to renew too. When I phoned back 2 days later he said it was too late and the mortgage had been rolled over into a 6 month fixed term. I ended up having to pay a $6000 penalty to get out of the mortgage and promptly closed all of my accounts and said goodbye to Scotia. This is how they rewarded me after 17 years of loyalty.

I spent the day on the phone trying to get the hold removed when I got a message that my account was in overdraft. I talked to the manager at this branch and she said they had to hold the cheque because a third party deposited it. Yet my parents home closed the same day and was deposited by their lawyer to a brand new Scotiabank account. No hold on their funds (and it was a much larger cheque). I've been a customer for over three years with no NSF's and a very good credit rating and my funds are held. I was told only my branch manager could remove the hold.

If you're having problems call this number first as you won't get any help from the branch or the help line.

I contacted my lawyer this morning and he said he uses this branch all the time and the branch manager never holds the certified cheques but all of a sudden they want to hold mine without letting me know.

I'll continue to update this review. Hopefully it won't take 15 days to resolve and that this will not affect my credit rating and incur extra charges from my investment company.

I hope this doesn't happen to other customers when selling their home. I've contacted my lawyer to let him know not to use this branch as well. But to be on the safe side just don't use Scotiabank at all."
1483,SiteJabber,NA,Don't bother expecting them to help the only thing they can seem to do is confirm you ID and move you in circles between departments.
1484,SiteJabber,NA,"Sooooo Frustrating called several times in a day one the morning one noon time and 3pm. Waited 40 minutes no available representative... Veryyyyy poooor service. March 15, called and March 16,2022."
1485,SiteJabber,NA,"As a long-time customer of the Scotiabank, the service has been on a steady decline in the last couple of years. If you have an issue with this bank good luck in getting a resolution and not to mention getting a hold of anyone to return your calls. If you call the Customer Care Center most of the agents are not capable of helping you out but they will make an appointment for you at your bank location which no one ever bothers calling you back. Then you follow their complaint process and, in the end, they (SCOTIABANK)is always right. This was my second issue with them)of not returning my calls) and no one, including my bank has ever called me back to discuss any of this. What are they hiding? The process: contact your bank. I did and I left a message a few weeks ago and thus far no one has bothered to call me back. I then emailed the Office of the President to confirm receipt of email. What do I get? Someone who has rehearsed and memorized a phrase that they continued to repeat that have ""24 hours to acknowledge receipt"" over and over again. This to me felt very condescending. To date, no one has ever contacted me or acknowledged receipt of my emails. I guess they believe they are following policies/procedures and do not need to do anything further. I also sent an email to the Office of the Ombudsman as per their process. They too have not responded. I believe they have 30 days to do so. The process is so lengthy and time consuming that I truly believe they hope one would give up or with time the issue will eventually ""go away"". This arrogance still does not negate the POOR customer Service received or make me feel any better.

Scotiabank, do us a favour and please invest more into your Customer Service! In case you did not know, it is common courtesy to return customer calls! Training employees to say sorry over and over again and having them reiterate a memorized script does not make me feel any better if NOTHING is done! You can do better!

I give you a ZERO for Customer Service. Hope you take these suggestions and do something about them.

1486,SiteJabber,NA,"I have waisted months trying to get Scotia Rewards to honor what they told me they would. I used my travel rewards card to book a trip for my family, through the Scotia Travel site. My flights were canceled and instead of Scotia sending us a email stating this cancelation they sent an email with no information just a number to call. I then spent 11 days trying to get through to Scotia travel only to be given aditude by the horrible customer service representative. It then took them nearly a month to refund my money and nearly four months to return my points. Now they will not let me use my points for the new flights I had to re book.

1488,SiteJabber,NA,"Scotia Bank American Express Gold card is the WORST card I have ever had! First of all the bank at Place d' Orleans in Orleans, Ontario promised me 20,000 promo points with no expiry date. They never mentioned additional monthly charges. When I went online to redeem my promo points one year later, they were no where to be found and after 4 online chats with no help where the points were I was referred to an 800 number and again several attempts to locate the promo points were unsuccessful. I was finally referred to yet another person who said there was a disclosure stating I was to use the card within 30 days to get the promo points. Now this information was never given to me. I feel I was tricked into getting this card with a promise that never exist. On top of the monthly fee, there are additional charges plus a $99 dollar annual fee. I have always paid the bill in full and only received very little points that cannot be redeemed for anything! DON'T APPLY FOR THIS CARD THROUGH SCOTIABANK! It's a bank PROMO SCAM!"
1489,SiteJabber,NA,"Out of 5 it's a ZERO! December 2021 I went to the Browns town branch to have my card change because I was about to travel. I spoke with a representative within the branch. Told her what was my issue and she advised me that my card will be sent out in the already. I have told her that I have been checking and nothing. She kept saying check with your postal agent. I left it and I went on my vacation to the state and back. Went to the bank again to have my card change. And the process is is rather time consuming and tiring. Took my lunch time from work hoping I would get this done n it was a waste of my lunch time. I turn to the sale rep and I asked isn't there a easier way to just get a replacement card that waiting ere in line her words were "" NO SIR"" I have to go back to work so can u please have them send me a new card in the can I make that request, NO SIR u have to wait. Have number 34 and having a job to return to. You all can do better. Implement SOP. That will better able to facilitate customers. There are ways to assign workers to get the job done in s more effective and efficient manner. Break the work load into specific job roles and the process can be much more effective. Am do turn off. I just transferred my salary from one back because of there service and now I feel I will be doing the same. You all need to fix this. U can't be going to the bank n spending the entire day just to get your business done. It's ridiculous. We are in a competitive market place n ppl have choices. Step up n put plans in place. Am hurt. I don't lie. I took time out today to get it done n I wasted my time. Poor service!"
1490,SiteJabber,NA,"I have a complaint in with Scotiabank, and ""coincidentally"" they have yet to process the transfers of registered accounts to another institution. They have had all needed information since November 22nd, yet continue to say they don't have the information, and that there is a blackout on the transfer of the RIF. I have searched high and low, and to the best of my knowledge, this is not a real thing. No one, including the person I spoke with at the Office of the President, has ever heard of this. Not the CRA, not anyone at the branch, not other banking professionals... NO ONE. It is not indicated in any documentation from Scotiabank or otherwise. The Voluntary Commitments and Code of Conduct Guidelines for Transfers of Registered Plans indicates that once all needed information is received, banks will endeavour to process transfers of deposit type registered plans in a maximum of seven business days. This couldn't be further from the truth! I am waiting on the transfer of a TFSA and RIF and neither have been processed. So now I have 3 complaints in with Scotiabank and continue to wait on responses, even though I have reached out numerous times, have provided all needed documentation, etc."

1493,SiteJabber,NA,"At one point I would have give 5 stars! My account was defrauded of a 975$! I was told it would take 9 days! After 10 days noone knew what I was talking about!? I was on the phone put on long waits! Transferred to 5 different people! This took 5 hours! I was told the money would be there in 5 days! Guess what!? Surprise! Not there! I talked to a very nice bank manager that assured me that was rediculous and she was in the fight for me. Finally once again I have to wait up to 3 business days I went in to the bank and I was very upset. Basically had to threaten that I wanted it today or I was leaving! Threaten not in a harmful way let's make that clear. Lol I didnt care how they got the money! Aghh they offered me an over draft... um are you kidding me!? Lol I told them that they could all take it out of there pockets and then get the money and see how they liked it. I then took all my money out of my account and said today and even then I have ro think about coming back.In a half an hour my money was there! Hmm what a surprise! I told them that with all I went through it didnt feel like enough! I had to use my rent money for the summer as I do not work! I told them that I feel I should be reimbursed that money for the upset! The emotional crap I had to go through and how I had to make threats before something happened!. The manager agreed. Hmm passive aggressive maybe. Idk. However I'm sure that wont happen. I also said or dont charge me for a year for using your bank. Lol
I'm sure I wonr hear back. It's too bad I really liked it until then."
1494,SiteJabber,NA,"Despite being a customer for many years, Scotiabank denied my existence because I left town for one year. They turned over all my child's education savings plan to the control of my ex partner, even though it is specified on file to not do so. After showing proof that I was a client, the person who denied that I ever existed as a client was conveniently let go or transferred. Recently, I was sold fraudulent concert tickets and I have tried tonight five times to report this fraud. Once the lady said that I didn't answer my questions correctly, even though I had The app open on my phone so I can answer the questions perfectly. The second time after answering the questions the man put me on hold and after five minutes it just hung up on me. I've called three more times and one time I recorded the entire call, and every time it transfers me to the fraud department to report the fraud, it just hangs up on me. Something very very strange is going on with Scotiabank and I'd like to know what it is. I had to replace my card because it suddenly was not working and they said it's because your tap only has a certain amount for the entire life of the card. They told me that your tap limits run out after a certain amount of taps. Forever and then you have to get a new card which nobody else that I know has had this experience. I went downtown to open a business account as an independent paralegal, and I was treated like garbage. Even as I try to get insurance for my paralegal service company, I am still being treated like absolute trash, all of this, despite finishing as one of the top students in my college class. I'm so sick of the discrimination, and if anybody else would give my black face an account anywhere else, I would leave Scotiabank. I need this fraud reported as soon as possible, and I need anybody involved at Scotiabank to also face legal consequences if that's the case. PS. After more than five years with this bank, I could still only withdraw $100 after depositing at the machine."
1495,SiteJabber,NA,"READ MY REVIEW FOR THE TRUTH
Hours terrible can't ever get to a branch on time after work, they hold your cheques for no good reasons and have ridiculous requirements for customers to meet that other banks don't, not going to get in too much detail.
Trying to reach your local branch or any branch by any means is unable to happen even if you get an extension number they wont even answer or call you back after leaving a message.
Interest rates are usually quite high for credit and debit accounts.
Tellers in branches are very unknowledgeable or rude depending on but most.
A big problem I have is if a transaction is cancled or failed on thier end it'll tell you insufficient funds when that isn't the case at all and takes many days to get your money back.
Scotiabank has very few atms, you can only take out multiples of $20 bills from ATM.
Scotiabank website is down almost every day, and has very few options to choose from resulting in you having to go to the bank yourself for a simple fix.
Theres also very few tellers so you'll be waiting in line for awhile.
CHOOSE ANOTHER BANK"

1497,SiteJabber,NA,"Do not apply for a Scotia Bank credit card. The bank does not help you when you have any issues with online purchases. I used my card for an online purchase with Walmart. It was a third-party purchase and Walmart and the third party were pointing fingers at each other as to who is responsible for the price match. This item was a cabinet bed and I was concerned that if there was an issue with the bed there would also be finger-pointing, so I decided to return the item. I never opened it. I emailed Walmart and responses were to come within a few days. They never did reply via email. I called customer service and was told they would send me a mailing label so this item could be returned. I never received a mailing label. 3 more calls with promises of a label. By this time my credit card payment was due for this item. I called Scotia Bank and they understood and told me not to pay it. They would put it on hold while they dispute the charge. That changed a number of days later when a different person called back from the resolution department. They told me to return the item and if Walmart then did not give me a refund Scotia Bank could then help me. I explained again that I could not just return the item to a store. It had to be shipped back to the third party. I asked Scotia Bank to help me with a mailing label from Walmart. Scotia Bank said they can not call a company on our behalf. I was willing to sign giving permission, but they just don't do this. This is a long story, but in the end since I did not pay for this item as I wanted it returned, Scotia Bank did not view me as their customer, they sent it off to collections. Nice work! I have never in my life not paid for an item. Never! The customer service with Walmart and Scotia Bank was absolutely unacceptable. The way I was treated by Scotia Bank was also unacceptable. They started harassing me instead of trying to help me. Do not use this bank."

I do mot wanna smile with him and also told him he has a short memory to which he assured me he didn't. The next thing that comes out of his mouth was "" you don't have to do business here you can go somewhere else"" I said ""make me"" his next reply was "" yes I can because I am the bank manager"" now I did not raise my voice nor was I an irate customer so why would this branch manger literally bully me to smile. That is odd that a manager to whom you already had a horrible experience with be literally be bullying me to smile. All I wanted to do is exactly what I went into the bank to do and leave like I ALWAYS do not expecting I would be bullied and harassed by a bank manager to smile. WOW!

I get told I need a licensed banker to do this by Kurtis mader. This man who is supposedly customer experience lead did absolutely nothing for me. An appointment would be several days away or I could use the phone cos there are licensed people on the phone... if I knew that I. Had this kind of account I would've never agreed to it. Kurtis mader brings nothing to the table.the people of Scotia bank pay for this man's wages and all I see him do is go on the computers. He does not help at all in customer service so why are we paying fir his services. Even when it is busy all he does is sit at his desk on the computer. It doesn't seem to matter to Kurtis mader that he sits behind a computer while people wait for 20 min to be serves... on his business card it says that he is a customer experience lead... where is his experience when all we see him do Is sit there and do absolutely nothing... some customer service. We are paying this useless man to do nothing... I wish I had a job like his. I am also in customer service and I tell you I do not treat people this way... I would ask Scotiabank to look into his useless occupation that we are paying for and let him and his customer experience lead to another position since he can't help anyone so what use is he... every time I go into the bank and it's really busy he doesn't get up from his computer to help... wow. Scotiabank really hit the jackpot when you hired this man who does absolutely nothing. Except sit at his computer... and don't tell me that he works at his computer for 8 hourd
1507,SiteJabber,NA,"We have been with this bank for over 20 years. Initially great. Since the change to run everything out of Toronto terrible. The move to the AI monitoring system is also a bust. I just put 30K on a credit line I have with them as a cushion for the upcoming 2023 uncertainty. I log on a couple of days later and they reduced the credit for that account down to 1K from 31K. I have had this credit line and a few others and 3 mortgages and a couple credit cards for the same amount of time. All in the name of business. I don't miss payments and they pull this stunt. This AI monitoring if you are late on a payment 1 day they can double your interest on that credit line for one year. They have done that to me twice. I was in the hospital when that happened this time. AND WE DO A TON OF BUSINESS WITH THEM / INCLUDING STOCKS They are very hard to deal with now. The branches still have some good people but they are just puppets now not financial experts like they once were. Poor customer service no one knows what they are doing OR can't do it because they are not allowed. Errors in billing can't be addressed because no one can help you - then you get sent somewhere else and the don't help you either - using the message center gets you the same thing ""you need to call customer service"" NO WONDER THEIR STOCK HAS BEEN BEATEN UP OVER THE PAST YEAR. We deal with several other banks and are moving everything from scotia - None of them are this. Don't bank there even as a good customer you get treated like a chump.

Transunion wanted me to talk to My creditors. They always talk about investments, which i do not wanna do... who will deal with the investment? With them they are not REPORTING ANYTHING TO CREDIT BUREAU... WORST BANK EVER NOVASCOTIA :( IT IS VERY STRESSFULL, IF SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO ME IT WILL BE ALL BECAUSE OF SCOTIABANK.

I went to the bank and said I was who I am and also gave them alll my documents. They flagged me for possible fraud, froze my lost card and my online banking. And told me to get a new ID prior to getting a new card. I went back and fourth and finally they said there was a way through the paperwork I already showed that they could get it working. They have taken literally all my documents and information (things they really shouldn't have had in the first place) and started copying it…

I feel like

1. I'm a victim of a hate crime,
2. Some of the money is gov security money (illegal)
3. An infringement of my privacy as well.

You say you LGTBQ+ friendly but at the end of the day the group you labeled me in is just another statistic at the end of the gay.

When you change your name you have to send in your birth certificate. They didn't send it back and I really at the time didn't care to much… well in order to get a new ID after it's expired you need a Birth certificate, which you need a bank card to get.

I currently have no choice but to have my finances put in said bank account but I have zero way to access them. I am renting now but literally with everything that's happening, being a dead beat dad, Christmas coming soon as well as rent… if I had a gun I $#*!ing shoot myself rather than deal with the $#*!ty dead beat I'm going to appear to be this Christmas….

I have little to no help in this word and you've financially set me up for failure. We live in Canada, Kelowna right now is-16. Honestly if a parent did this to a child is would be neglected and they would go to jail.

1516,SiteJabber,NA,"Do not use Scotia Bank! They are a pugnacious institution. I was with this bank from 2001 to 2018 at North Van and Lonsdale Branch. Up until 2017 I was highly satisfied, I had a bank representative that would proactively reach out to renew my mortgage etc.

In 2018 my mortgage came up for renewal. I left a few messages with my new Bank Representative who never returned my calls, had no voice mail, and left a 1 800 number on her message (later found out she was on mat leave but no mention in her phone message). Eventually I contacted their central team and the interest rates offered were very uncompetitive with the market offering at the time. I told the rep that I would be placing my mortgage with another institution.

Unfortunately my new bank did not complete the paper work in time and the mortgage renewed automatically into a 5% 6 month term (highway robbery). Another rep at the branch had sent an email to my old email address about a month before the maturity date and obviously got a bounce back message but never acknowledged. He then left a V. M. on my phone the day before the maturity date indicating he wanted to confirm what type of mortgage to renew too. When I phoned back 2 days later he said it was too late and the mortgage had been rolled over into a 6 month fixed term. I ended up having to pay a $6000 penalty to get out of the mortgage and promptly closed all of my accounts and said goodbye to Scotia. This is how they rewarded me after 17 years of loyalty. Do not use this bank, stay away, they are a malicious, heartless institution and will likely fade in the coming years as it looks as though there are several other disappointed customers out there."
1517,SiteJabber,NA,"DO NOT BANK WITH SCOTIA!
Their employees know zero about banking, they will give you the run around, and if you phone they'll put you on hold endlessly.
Then they will say they will set up what you need in the future, but when you check in later, NOTHING WILL HAVE BEEN DONE! And the whole incompetent run around will start again.
I kid you not, they will put you on hold for hours, trying to figure out how to solve your BASIC(!) REQUEST.
Then if and when you ask for a manager or supervisor, to complain, the run around will just continue, putting you on hold endlessly.

I have tried going to 3 different branches and talked on the phone, with said above process, 3 times.
Now, is it super complicated what I ask?, you wonder. NO!
Just a stop payment.

It would have been, and will be, faster to go to a different bank and open an account there!

1519,SiteJabber,NA,"Realestate lawyers beware of this branch (Yonge and Bullock)- This branch will hold a certified cheque from the sale of you home because the lawyer deposited it. This could potentially hold up your clients purchase of their next home or a transfer to their investment account if they haven't purchased a home yet.

I spent the day on the phone trying to get the hold removed when I got a message that my account was in overdraft. I talked to the manager at this branch and she said they had to hold the cheque because a third party deposited it. Yet my parents home closed the same day and was deposited by their lawyer to a brand new Scotiabank account. No hold on their funds (and it was a much larger cheque). I've been a customer for over three years with no NSF's and a very good credit rating and my funds are held. I was told only my branch manager could remove the hold. I spent the day trying to contact her with no luck. I eventually got the number to the presidents office *******043 and was told it may take up to 15 days to resolve. If you're having problems call this number first as you won't get any help from the branch or the help line.

I contacted my lawyer this morning and he said he uses this branch all the time and the branch manager never holds the certified cheques but all of a sudden they want to hold mine without letting me know.

I'll continue to update this review. Hopefully it won't take 15 days to resolve and that this will not affect my credit rating and incur extra charges from my investment company.

I hope this doesn't happen to other customers when selling their home. I've contacted my lawyer to let him know not to use this branch as well. But to be on the safe side just don't use Scotiabank at all."

To date, no one has ever contacted me or acknowledged receipt of my emails. I guess they believe they are following policies/procedures and do not need to do anything further.

1524,SiteJabber,NA,Two hours on the phone to find out out why a simple transfer wouldn't go through. Person I talked with had no idea and was extremely rude.
1525,SiteJabber,NA,"Scotia Bank American Express Gold card is the WORST card I have ever had! First of all the bank at Place d' Orleans in Orleans, Ontario promised me 20,000 promo points with no expiry date. They never mentioned additional monthly charges. When I went online to redeem my promo points one year later, they were no where to be found and after 4 online chats with no help where the points were I was referred to an 800 number and again several attempts to locate the promo points were unsuccessful. I was finally referred to yet another person who said there was a disclosure stating I was to use the card within 30 days to get the promo points. Now this information was never given to me. I feel I was tricked into getting this card with a promise that never exist. On top of the monthly fee, there are additional charges plus a $99 dollar annual fee. I have always paid the bill in full and only received very little points that cannot be redeemed for anything! DON'T APPLY FOR THIS CARD THROUGH SCOTIABANK! It's a bank PROMO SCAM!"
1526,SiteJabber,NA,"Out of 5 it's a ZERO! December 2021 I went to the Browns town branch to have my card change because I was about to travel. I spoke with a representative within the branch. Told her what was my issue and she advised me that my card will be sent out in the already. I have told her that I have been checking and nothing. She kept saying check with your postal agent. I left it and I went on my vacation to the state and back. Went to the bank again to have my card change. And the process is is rather time consuming and tiring. Took my lunch time from work hoping I would get this done n it was a waste of my lunch time. I turn to the sale rep and I asked isn't there a easier way to just get a replacement card that waiting ere in line her words were "" NO SIR"" I have to go back to work so can u please have them send me a new card in the can I make that request, NO SIR u have to wait. Have number 34 and having a job to return to. You all can do better. Implement SOP. That will better able to facilitate customers. There are ways to assign workers to get the job done in s more effective and efficient manner. Break the work load into specific job roles and the process can be much more effective. Am do turn off. I just transferred my salary from one back because of there service and now I feel I will be doing the same. You all need to fix this. U can't be going to the bank n spending the entire day just to get your business done. It's ridiculous. We are in a competitive market place n ppl have choices. Step up n put plans in place. Am hurt. I don't lie. I took time out today to get it done n I wasted my time. Poor service!"
1527,SiteJabber,NA,"I have a complaint in with Scotiabank, and ""coincidentally"" they have yet to process the transfers of registered accounts to another institution. They have had all needed information since November 22nd, yet continue to say they don't have the information, and that there is a blackout on the transfer of the RIF. I have searched high and low, and to the best of my knowledge, this is not a real thing. No one, including the person I spoke with at the Office of the President, has ever heard of this. Not the CRA, not anyone at the branch, not other banking professionals... NO ONE. It is not indicated in any documentation from Scotiabank or otherwise. The Voluntary Commitments and Code of Conduct Guidelines for Transfers of Registered Plans indicates that once all needed information is received, banks will endeavour to process transfers of deposit type registered plans in a maximum of seven business days. This couldn't be further from the truth! I am waiting on the transfer of a TFSA and RIF and neither have been processed. So now I have 3 complaints in with Scotiabank and continue to wait on responses, even though I have reached out numerous times, have provided all needed documentation, etc."
1528,SiteJabber,NA,June from Lethbridge branch is amazing and fully understood our situation God bless you June thank you so much
1529,SiteJabber,NA,How do you like waiting on hold for 30 min each time you need to talk to a representative? Or just all-around unreliable and subpar services?
1530,SiteJabber,NA,"At one point I would have give 5 stars! My account was defrauded of a 975$! I was told it would take 9 days! After 10 days noone knew what I was talking about!? I was on the phone put on long waits! Transferred to 5 different people! This took 5 hours! I was told the money would be there in 5 days! Guess what!? Surprise! Not there! I talked to a very nice bank manager that assured me that was rediculous and she was in the fight for me. Finally once again I have to wait up to 3 business days I went in to the bank and I was very upset. Basically had to threaten that I wanted it today or I was leaving! Threaten not in a harmful way let's make that clear. Lol I didnt care how they got the money! Aghh they offered me an over draft... um are you kidding me!? Lol I told them that they could all take it out of there pockets and then get the money and see how they liked it. I then took all my money out of my account and said today and even then I have ro think about coming back.In a half an hour my money was there! Hmm what a surprise! I told them that with all I went through it didnt feel like enough! I had to use my rent money for the summer as I do not work! I told them that I feel I should be reimbursed that money for the upset! The emotional crap I had to go through and how I had to make threats before something happened!. The manager agreed. Hmm passive aggressive maybe. Idk. However I'm sure that wont happen. I also said or dont charge me for a year for using your bank. Lol
I'm sure I wonr hear back. It's too bad I really liked it until then."
1531,SiteJabber,NA,"Despite being a customer for many years, Scotiabank denied my existence because I left town for one year. They turned over all my child's education savings plan to the control of my ex partner, even though it is specified on file to not do so. After showing proof that I was a client, the person who denied that I ever existed as a client was conveniently let go or transferred. Recently, I was sold fraudulent concert tickets and I have tried tonight five times to report this fraud. Once the lady said that I didn't answer my questions correctly, even though I had The app open on my phone so I can answer the questions perfectly. The second time after answering the questions the man put me on hold and after five minutes it just hung up on me. I've called three more times and one time I recorded the entire call, and every time it transfers me to the fraud department to report the fraud, it just hangs up on me. Something very very strange is going on with Scotiabank and I'd like to know what it is. I had to replace my card because it suddenly was not working and they said it's because your tap only has a certain amount for the entire life of the card. They told me that your tap limits run out after a certain amount of taps. Forever and then you have to get a new card which nobody else that I know has had this experience. I went downtown to open a business account as an independent paralegal, and I was treated like garbage. Even as I try to get insurance for my paralegal service company, I am still being treated like absolute trash, all of this, despite finishing as one of the top students in my college class. I'm so sick of the discrimination, and if anybody else would give my black face an account anywhere else, I would leave Scotiabank. I need this fraud reported as soon as possible, and I need anybody involved at Scotiabank to also face legal consequences if that's the case. PS. After more than five years with this bank, I could still only withdraw $100 after depositing at the machine."
1532,SiteJabber,NA,"READ MY REVIEW FOR THE TRUTH
Hours terrible can't ever get to a branch on time after work, they hold your cheques for no good reasons and have ridiculous requirements for customers to meet that other banks don't, not going to get in too much detail.
Trying to reach your local branch or any branch by any means is unable to happen even if you get an extension number they wont even answer or call you back after leaving a message.
Interest rates are usually quite high for credit and debit accounts.
Tellers in branches are very unknowledgeable or rude depending on but most.
A big problem I have is if a transaction is cancled or failed on thier end it'll tell you insufficient funds when that isn't the case at all and takes many days to get your money back.
Scotiabank has very few atms, you can only take out multiples of $20 bills from ATM.
Scotiabank website is down almost every day, and has very few options to choose from resulting in you having to go to the bank yourself for a simple fix.
Theres also very few tellers so you'll be waiting in line for awhile.
CHOOSE ANOTHER BANK"
1533,SiteJabber,NA,"This peace of sh*t bank is Scam and fraud.

Don't ever use this stupid bank otherwise you'll go bankruptcy for sure. Thieves"
1534,SiteJabber,NA,"Do not apply for a Scotia Bank credit card. The bank does not help you when you have any issues with online purchases. I used my card for an online purchase with Walmart. It was a third-party purchase and Walmart and the third party were pointing fingers at each other as to who is responsible for the price match. This item was a cabinet bed and I was concerned that if there was an issue with the bed there would also be finger-pointing, so I decided to return the item. I never opened it. I emailed Walmart and responses were to come within a few days. They never did reply via email. I called customer service and was told they would send me a mailing label so this item could be returned. I never received a mailing label. 3 more calls with promises of a label. By this time my credit card payment was due for this item. I called Scotia Bank and they understood and told me not to pay it. They would put it on hold while they dispute the charge. That changed a number of days later when a different person called back from the resolution department. They told me to return the item and if Walmart then did not give me a refund Scotia Bank could then help me. I explained again that I could not just return the item to a store. It had to be shipped back to the third party. I asked Scotia Bank to help me with a mailing label from Walmart. Scotia Bank said they can not call a company on our behalf. I was willing to sign giving permission, but they just don't do this. This is a long story, but in the end since I did not pay for this item as I wanted it returned, Scotia Bank did not view me as their customer, they sent it off to collections. Nice work! I have never in my life not paid for an item. Never! The customer service with Walmart and Scotia Bank was absolutely unacceptable. The way I was treated by Scotia Bank was also unacceptable. They started harassing me instead of trying to help me. Do not use this bank."
1535,SiteJabber,NA,"Long waiting time, dont call them ever

1540,Trust Pilot ,NA,Never sign for a visa card with Scotiabank. They are the worst. They do not send you an account statement showing all your transactions once you choose to close your account with them. If you have a positive balance on the card ( meaning they owe you that money) they take an eternity to pay you the due amount. Will never do business with them ever again. I moved my mortgage to another bank for bad customer services years ago. I only had the visa card left with them. The overall services of Scotiabank are bad. No surprise when seeing how they treat their customers.
1541,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I have had this account for 6years and it got blocked because I logged in from outside Canada while on a business trip. I have tried so many times to communicate the situation and submit necessary verification documents, however nothing is happening.

1542,Trust Pilot ,NA,I need to deal with an estate account. Every branch/person I speak to gives me conflicting answers. Their policies seem to change depending on who you speak to. I was finally told they dont handle estate business in-branch (and didnt direct me anywhere). So I call and the phone representatives dont know how to get me through to the estate department. This bank is an absolute mess.
1543,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I don't know what kind of third-rate operation they are running here, but the level of service they are providing is COMPLETELY unacceptable. I am running on my THIRD cancelled appointment in the past 2-3 months, all of which I must carefully schedule weeks ahead of time. Oh, sorry, they only cancelled twice. The first one, they just completely stood me up—the business was shuttered when I arrived. Do they meet with ANY of their customers, or is it just me they have a personal grudge against???"
1544,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Do not choose Scotiabank. Humble request!I am saying this after being with them for 9 years now.Worst, rudest and most irresponsible customer service ever I experienced. At 4:00 AM I called for a simple request they kept transferring me across departments and the last person who received my call just dropped it. I train people in customer service so I exactly know how calls are dropped."
1545,Trust Pilot ,NA,I wish to formally report a case of repeated mistreatment by an employee at Scotiabank Royal Oak branch. I'm are deeply concerned about the recurring unprofessional behavior and disrespectful treatment to me by a member of your staff named Jade
1546,Trust Pilot ,NA,"The new online access and specifically reports/screens that are replacing the existing ""Classic View"" are cumbersome and when printed are missing investment accounts and other information. They require a lot more pages and extra printing. The print function button has been dropped from many of the new screens and if printed using a screen dump there is no print date shown (blocked ?) and some accounts are missing. We have completed a survey, filed online a complaint and also contacted our branch a month ago and have not received any request for more information or reply to our emails or explanation as to our query and any possible resolution. Meanwhile, the online report problems are still there. We are concerned that other customers may not be aware of these problems and strongly suggest that at least monthly they take the time to closely review and print all reports concerning their business with this bank. They should not have confidence in the system."

1548,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Screwing around with Scotiabank for my mortgage renewal which I have had for 35 years.Tried online, my wife's name who has been deceased for a year, is still on the mortgage. They will not renew it online, which has a lower interest rate, as you are not involving the branch.Phoned the Toronto Mortgage center same response. Told to ask the branch to prove my wife's name has been removed. Had an appointment at my branch. They say the rate will be higher as I am now dealing with the branch to renew it. One year later, what a screwed-up bank, I have now given them the Land Transfer Title and my wife's death certificate, three times. I was told, the information may have been lost in the bereavement department.There attitude stinks.I have another account at CIBC.They are a lot more helpful."
1549,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotiabank at 1547 Bayview Avenue. I entered the bank 20 minutes before closing time, the teller refused to serve me. When I insisted on seeing the manager  he dealt with my issue in 5 minutes. The bank was absolutely empty; I was the only customer, so they gave me 5 minutes of their time. Awful customer service, no consideration that each customer is a valued client. Just don't take up our precious time -is the prevailing attitude."
1550,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotia bank took over Tangerine. It's the worst ever. Someone stole my wallet complete with my bus and everything. By the time i had realized  my wallet was gone, the person had made almost 400$ of purchases. called Tangerine the date of the theft and 9th and the18th, each time i talked with a rep they were just opening an investigation I also made a police report, the  suspect was I.D.ed on camera the police knew the suspect who is a man. i told Tangerine but they  have never contacted the police and they have not returned my money. I also had to argue to get the TAP taken off my card. it is now the 26th and still no money. i feel that i have been stolen from twice once by that guy and a second time by my bank.

1551,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Serious Concerns Regarding My Account and Customer Service ExperienceDear Scotiabank Team,I am writing to express my deep frustration regarding the ongoing issues with my account and the unsatisfactory service I've received over the past several years. Despite my long-standing relationship with Scotiabank, I continue to encounter problems that are neither acceptable nor addressed satisfactorily.Recently, I noticed that funds from my account were moved to an RRSP without my explicit consent. I took the time to visit a branch in person, where I signed several documents and was assured the situation was under control. However, the same issue recurred, and when I called the branch for assistance, I was met with long wait times and a lack of resolution.This is not the level of service I expect from a financial institution I have been loyal to for nearly 25-30 years. I urge you to look into this matter urgently and provide a satisfactory solution. Otherwise, I may be forced to reconsider my banking relationship with Scotiabank.Sincerely,"
1552,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotia Bank posts low rates for mortgages. Then, upon application and after wasting your time with credit checks that impact your credit rating, their head office comes back with a rate that's higher than your current bank! They said, 'Oh, it could be as low as 3.8%,' which is advertised to jerk your chain, but then they come back with 4.69%! That's amusing, especially since it's after the feds lowered the rates by half a point. What's even worse is when you call them to discuss what's going on in terms of what you were promised - if anything - a low rate. They won't even return your call! It's like dealing with Windows tech support in India. It's so useless that it calls for an expletive. I guess that's why I haven't banked with them for over 25 years and why I won't ever consider trusting what they offer. Don't get sucked into Scotia Bank offers. They are total ad scams. And, for the record, my credit score is also over 800! DEPLORABLE ABHORRENT BANKING"
1553,Trust Pilot ,NA,Scotia's new personal banking interface sucks.It's like they decided to hide everything you are looking for. They took away the option of downloading account transactions to popular financial software. Who in their right mind just takes away those functions?

1564,Trust Pilot ,NA,"If zero stars were an option I would put that but its not. Please if you are with Scotiabank, GTFO! I had been with them since I was a kid and just left in 2024. In the last 5 years (2019 - 2024) I have been scammed, had multiple Visa cards fraudulently impacted and from this, people who had gotten ahold of my credit card number then were able to get into MY bank account and attempt to move TSFA money around! Insanity. I have never recieved any accomidations for any of my troubles over the years in having to go in and deal with all these impacted credit cards and the rest of what follows in the fraud claims. I worry all the time now that people are in my bank account and know my credit card number so I am always checking in on my RBC accounts. Switch to RBC, TD, literally anyone else but Scotiabank. This company is like having a 13 year old control your finances. They have destroyed my credit score which then I had to contact Trns Union and EquaFax to get sorted out. Since then they have been calling me non stop, hanging up the phone when I answer, and saying I have to pay them more money from the fraud charges on the last credit card I had cancelled. An absolute mess and disaster of a company and a complete joke to call a bank. I feel bad for anyone who has to work there in any department. Sincerely - LDog NADALUTTI"
1565,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Their staff will hang out the call-staff are well unprepared (specially over phone)-The information in there website, requires desperately an ""update"" specifically, how much money, you can withdraw in a day.-Poor listening Skills, even if you complain.  So I decided to end my account, here."
1566,Trust Pilot ,NA,I put one star because I can’t put 0 stars. Not the worst bank but the worst managed corporation I’ve ever seen. It took me 5 years to take a decision after many nightmarish experiences but when I realized my money wasn’t safe in that bank that was it. You wanna find out if it’s true please go ahead and open your account with them
1567,Trust Pilot ,NA,I would put zero stars if I could. Scotia bank doesn't follow their own policies and then screw you over and make it impossible to get your own money. They are rude unhelpful and occasionally follow their own rules and when asked why sometimes they follow there policy and other times they do not they don't have an answer.

1570,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I moved overseas and so they sent my new card to my old address and therefore, they blocked me from accessing my online banking. I called to get a new card sent out but they couldn't send one because I couldn't provide an account number after they already verified my identity. How would I have access to any of my accounts if they blocked my online banking? Pretty pointless having a lost card hotline if you can't even send a new card especially when you've blocked me from logging into my online banking. I've been a loyal customer for years and this is how I'm treated. Definitely cancelling my accounts once I get all this sorted and can transfer all my money out. Thanks Scotiabank."
1571,Trust Pilot ,NA,"The absolute worst financial institution in Canada with terrible customer service. I once had difficulty signing in with a new device, so I called customer service.

1574,Trust Pilot ,NA,"In 2022 I had my business account with Scotiabank & I had to wire funds from a USA business bank account multiple times per month like 6 to 8 times, Scotiabank had no set wire transfer fee for accepting the wire transfer & just charged me what ever they wanted. First it was $56 then $68 then $76 then $86 then $96 that’s when I finally complained and scotiabank said well we have no set fee for accepting a wire transfer! I replied this is not legal this is not proper business services for your bank or any bank! They did not seem to care but I did notice the wire transfer fee seemed to become steady at $80 per each wire transfer they accepted! Then one day in august of 2022 a female Indian teller/ service representative refused to help me & I said no I’m here to get this fixed I could not access my account & the assistant manager came over & said we don’t like how your talking to her leave! I said no I ain’t going anywhere until she or you or someone fixes my account! That assistant manager stepped out from behind the counter into the middle of the bank & started screaming at me that I was leaving there bank one way or the other & kicked off her shoes! She then yelled your leaving this bank one way or the other you choose how! The female Indian teller run to the back to get the bank manager who came out & the female Indian teller said now you’re going to get it! The manager turned & looked at her & said shut up! Then he seen his assistant manager in the middle of the bank with her shoes off and he said why are you standing in the middle of the bank with your shoes off? The assistant manager yelled cause he is leaving this bank one way or the other! The manger said okay what is going on here? Your threatening customers with physical violence to physically remove them from our bank? He then looked at me & seen me standing there with my cane & said & he is handicapped! What is wrong with you! He could sue us & then sue you as well! Go to my office I will deal with you later! You were a bouncer in a bc night club and I hired you & gave you a chance & put you through training all the way to assistant manager and this is how you act! This is how you treat customers! This is how you repay me! Then the manager asked me questions and asked the female Indian teller questions to get to the bottom of all this & this female Indian teller just stood there and the manager asked her what’s the problem she would not answer! He asked her is this customer verbally or physically attacking you, she finally replied no, then said he is racist! The manager said that’s a pretty strong accusation! Did he use defamation of character? She would not answer he asked her did he comment on your race or skin colour? She just stood there and would not answer, finally she shouted no then the manager said now your yelling at me your manager? What is wrong with you? This manager then questioned me & asked what the problem was & I told him I could not access my account from the banking app she says she can’t fix it call 1-800# and I said no I am here in person, then your assistant manager walked over & said we don’t like how your talking to her leave, he said she did not come over and say sir what seems to be the problem I am the assistant manager here how can I help you & calm the situation down or even try to find out what the problem was she just went off on me! Then I was asked what my medical issues were and I told him the long list. The manager then told the teller/customer service rep you accused this customer who is very handicapped of being racist I don’t understand why but do you know he can sue this bank and then sue you personally and sue the assistant manager personally as well?I am send both of you back to customer service training! He apologized to me & said he was transferring soon to another Scotiabank location because that location at 68st NE Calgary was nothing but that kind of trouble at least 5 out of 6 days they are open!1 year later at that same location the same 2 ladies the teller & the same assistant manager did almost the same thing to me, but I left I walked out then the new male Indian manager closes my accounts kicked me out and sent me an email & a letter I had to go there and sign something and officially close my accounts & to cover myself I took my my Chinese friend Mike with me, we walked in & I had to explain to the teller what the new manager wanted, they had no clue, then they brought out the assistant manager that same Asian female that threaten to physically remove me! She seen I was with my friend Mike a Chinese guy & I am white so I would not be accused of being racist & Mike was there in case they yelled at me or threatened me so I would have a witness! all was peaceful. Now today November 1st 2024 I went to a different location of Scotiabank to open a checking account they updated my address & phone number then handed me a letter kicking me out! Do not use Scotiabank!"
1575,Trust Pilot ,NA,If you are having a customer service issue at the Scotiabank on Hespeler Rd in Cambridge I recommend that you ask for Hiren Rawal. He is very courteous and professional. He helped us with a seemingly difficult task with great efficiency. He is a credit to his branch and I hope that Scotiabank will do everything they can to retain his services for a long time to come.
1576,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Be very careful of making an e-transfer with scotia. Extremely unsecure method to pay someone. I didn't realize I had made a spelling error on an email, and sent $800 to a person I do not know. Scotia has changed there system to auto deposit witch means you can not unsend a transfer or cancel it. There is no safeguard or security questions and scotia bank has wiped there hands of any responsibility for there own bank system. I am now missing $800 because of a single missing character on an email??? I will now have to take some random person to court while I am trying to go to college to get my money back. Great job Scotia Thanks..."
1577,Trust Pilot ,NA,Im honestly at my wits end with scotiabank online. Spend some money and hire people who actually know how to maintain your desktop and online banking apps. I shouldn't have to wait days to pay off my bills because you're online platform keeps corrupting.
1578,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Terrible Online Customer Service. The representatives just waste time by lying to pass from 1 department to another. They transfered me 5 times to different departments to cancel a card. They have no idea what they are doing, very poorly trained. I think they are just collecting money and doing nothing at work. Save yourself the pain of calling by not opening any account with Scotia if possible as their work quality has dropped."
1579,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Terrible experience. Dear readers, if I had the possibility to give them negative stars I would do it in a blink of an eye.And second thing, my fear is that even we give them so many bad reviews they will still offer bad services so that our hope that they will ever enhance just a little bit their service is in vain.I called their Customer Service number and after waiting tens and tens of minutes, eventually an agent called herself Paula, picket up the phone. After she claimed that she couldn't help me with my problem, I asked her to pass me the manager. She told me to wait on the line and 2 seconds later she disconnected me."
1580,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotiabank 2 tiered login is simply garbage! My wife can't log in all day but if I log in from my phone it sends her the code and I enter it and I'm in her account. This has been happening on and off for months now. Thinking of moving banks, their service is crap and useless with no support. On line support says go to branch, branch has no idea and says contact on line. No wonder they get breached, nothing works and IT seems incopentant."
1581,Trust Pilot ,NA,Hotline agents don't know how to communicate clearly and some dont even speak fluently. I was rejected  for safety box rental at all branches  in Markham area. Even hotline agents named casar and Alex i spoke to told me those branch has lots of safety boxes appear on the system. Service in Markham area are very terrible run by the Chinese! I cant strentch enough how terrible my experience was . 8580 warden Ave. Markham5000 hwy7 Management are extremely poor! Not recommand scotia or any other branches in Markham!
1582,Trust Pilot ,NA,I was used to get $1500 cash back on my monthly cheque deposit. The bank suddenly decreased limit to $100. I have been loyal customer for 7 years. This is totally ridiculous. They should know that there are numbers of another banks in the market. I am going to switch to another bank after their bullish services. Please don’t choose this bank.
1583,Trust Pilot ,NA,scotia back loans is a rip off if you pay the loan off 6 years earlier it still the same amout no dont save any money. im 67 years old and never heard of this before they want to keep all the interest even if you pay the load off early
1584,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I have been a Scotiabank customer for over a decade and recently Scotiabank moved to a new interface that does not work properly.  First it does not show all my accounts and second the new interface is missing some key features currently found Classic interface.  More recently, the number of accounts the new interface displays has begun to fluctuate from 7 to 10 accounts and then inexplicably reverts back which leads to concerns about the stability and security of the system.  Scotiabank has not communicated what is happening or when it will be fixed.  After over a month of trying to get the most basic issues fixed...I give up and am transitioning to a new bank."
1585,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I am aware Scotia Bank is going through major updates and changes to online banking, but this has been continuing for months where I have limited access to the app and account ""services"". Yet my service charges are still on time.Why can this not be done overnights. Better get it resolved soon, I am nearing my wits end and my patience is wearing thin."
1586,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I'm more stressed than a cat in a room full of rocking chairs, and these bozos are masters of messing with my head. After months of dealing with their nonsense, I've got diddly squat to show for it. If I were you, I'd steer clear to avoid the same headache. Now,     (echelonis         elitus)?       They're my saving grace. They swooped in    and saved me from this circus, and they've been nothing short of amazing."
1587,Trust Pilot ,NA,"**** THIS BANKING SITECONSTANT 2 STEP VERIFICATION, CONSTANT RETURN TO SIGN IN. CONSTANT ENTERING CARD NUMBER AND PASSWORD EVERY SINGLE PAGE.PATHETIC. NO WAY TO ACCESS MY ACCOUNT.2 STEP VERIFICATION ON LAPTOP, USING CHROME, EDGE, BRAVE, FIREFOX AND SAFARI. WHAT THE HELL!!!HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE SAME EXACT **** ON THE APP.GET YOUR SITE TOGETHER SCOTIABANK.TD CANADA TRUST, NEVER HAS ISSUES LIKE THIS, EVEN SIMPLII FINANCIAL, ENTER A CODE ONCE AND DONE.I WILL NEVER BANK WITH SCOTIABANK AGAIN, I WILL JUST CLOSE THE ******* ACCOUNT AND TAKE MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE, I ADVISE ANYONE ELSE TO DO THE SAME"
1588,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Everything started with my mortage issue. Before my 5 year mortage contract was finished, i called the mortage centre and i specified to the operator to NOT renew my mortage, and they still renewed it WITHOUT my consent. Four days after my renewal date , a renewal institution recieved a payout since i was going to be moving to their company and scotia bank included their payout of $6530.93 in which they called it their 3 month interest, after i specified to them TWICE to not roll over my mortage. It seems to be a run over because no one has an answer to this situation and no one has CONTACTED me as well. I have been trying to get a hold of the highest level of power within their company yet i still recieve no response. This is simply your issue and not mine. $6530.93 may not be anything for this institution but for a man who works every day he can, it is. It seems to be that a verbal agreement only is put into place when it benefits this bank. So be careful to those people who are currently dealing with this bank or who are trying to. If i could give a negative number on the scale i definitly would."
1589,Trust Pilot ,NA,Worst online banking app! They made it so secure and I have no way accessing my account. After several months multiple international support calls. Finally I can access my account only to find that it stops working again.
1590,Trust Pilot ,NA,They want me to waste a work day at the bank branch instead of solving the problem ON their useless app to accept an offer.Prefer switching to another bank knows how to help their customers and saves their time
1591,Trust Pilot ,NA,My experience with scotiabank was a little peculiar because they didn't like my spending habits.They told me how to spend my money.What to spend it on and if I didn't like their rules they would end the relationship what kind of a bank says that to a customer
1592,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Been a customer of Scotiabank for over 30 years now and I can definitively say that things have deteriorated to the lowest of lows. Customer service is beyond shocking at this bank. Not only are the tellers and financial advisors incompetent, but the service over the phone is unbearable. First, they couldn't even help me withdraw money from my son's RESP to pay for his university. Had to go to 3 different branches and multiple appointments until someone finally figured it out. Second, I switched to a new Basic Chequing Account and had to apply for an overdraft all over again. A month later, still no overdraft, and I have had to jump through hoops to get approved for a measly few hundred dollars for emergency purposes only. What's confusing to me is I have a 38K line of credit that I've used multiple times over the years for large purchases and have always paid it off in full, never missed a payment. I dont have credit card debt and the Line of Credit balance is at zero. Still won't approve a $500 overdraft.....Unreal! I am done and will take my banking needs elsewhere. So glad I didn't bother to try getting my $460,000 mortgage through them. Would have needed to give up my left lung to get it! Give your head a shake Scotiabank!"
1593,Trust Pilot ,NA,Bloor West location assistant manager Shaya is rude and condescending person and will laugh in your face when you have genuine questions or concerns that she apparently finds funny if you are struggling. I went in asking about 2$ American she found it funny I was concerned about getting a few dollars . Claimed it’s not her problem and then months later went out of her way to have my accounts closed based off what she said. I literally cried trying to talk to her and she laughed in my face .
1594,Trust Pilot ,NA,Someone signed up using my email could not contact them through any help line or emails tried countless times to do so. Now getting emails saying payments are needed of over 2000 dollars I'm from the UK not even from the USA or Canada. I do not want to be associated with an account with them but can't do anything to do so.
1595,Trust Pilot ,NA,I visited the  branch in St Ann’s Bay Jamaica.Do not waste your time with this bank. I waited over 4 hours to see someone. The bank staff just wandering around and ignoring customers.People have been waiting from the bank opened its doors until it closed.No apologies and no updates as to why we have to sit all day whilst they stare into their computers.I asked a man who seemed to be a manager where is the staff as only two people serving with over 2 hours with each customer.He said he would find out. He never came back to give me an answer.They treat the customers like second class citizens.Absolutely disgraceful treatment of customers.
1596,Trust Pilot ,NA,Worst bank ever.Customer service is a foreign call centre now to avoid direct complaints to the various branches.Service fees are way too high for accounts and credit cards.No more money available on abm deposits just a 5 day wait.Hours of operation at all locations make it impossible to visit if you work full time.Always closed all day Saturday.Tellers should all be fired for even half of the smart ass responses I have heard from a teller to a customer.Don't even think about opening an account with Scotiabank.You will have nothing but grief and stress
1597,Trust Pilot ,NA,"The manager of your Branch on 2880 Majors MacKenzie,  Vaughn,  ON told me:  I DON'T KNOW WHERE ARE YOU FROM!!! HERE IS CANADA!! IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW THINGS ARE IN CANADA,  GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY!!!! I tried to contact the customer support at Scotiabank. However,  in the Emil I received from customer support,  they even didn't mention anything about the manager's disgusteing chrap racist comment!!  The customer support totally ignored the comment and just made general comments regarding how important are the customers to them!!!! FYI, we don't stop here, we use every single tools we have to notify everyone about how you treat others. Your manager and customer support disgusteing and racist behavior should not happen to anyone else.  How Scotiabank Customer support! Supported their recist manager comment should be shameful for Scotiabank"
1598,Trust Pilot ,NA,"If you use the Scotia app as verification, you can't use text verification; and have to call in to reset.  However, if you DON'T use the app, then you can just use the website either from your tablet/ipad or your laptop with text verification o phone (even an old one).Bruce A"
1599,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I had talked to Sky (highbury branch), a customer service, she is not accommodating at all. I guess she is lazy in what she's doing. No passion to serve customer all! Pissed my day."
1600,Trust Pilot ,NA,"On their webpage they advertise their Preferred Package for new permanent residents with $0 monthly fee for a year without having to maintain at least $4000 to waive the $16.95. But once you opened this checking account, you get charged $16.95 on the last day of the month. Their customer service over the phone couldn’t even help you to fix this problem. I will visit the branch where I opened this checking account and cash out my money and close the account."
1601,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Never ever use Scotiabank for business. It is honestly the worst decision I ever made to bank with Scotia. They have become such a hindrance that the number one issue keeping my company from moving forward is scotiabank. The customer service is atrocious, you can never build a rapport with your business Banker because it seems like they're always just going through the motions in that position until they go on to bigger and better things. They constantly ignore requests for overdraft protection when it should be granted and are happy to take $192 NSF fees!! It's like dealing with robots as opposed to actual people it's truly as if these people have never been out in the world as individuals and as soon as they get behind the desk at the bank they treat everyone around them like a lowly little peon. In regards to an individual situation I don't have enough space here nor the time to write out all of them but the list goes on and on. At this point all I can do is warn people before they get involved and go through the arduous process of switching business bank accounts. It didn't used to be like this, there were times years ago when I found actual help with issues but these days absolutely not. You're lucky if you even talk to the same person 3 weeks later."
1602,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Sales people are very pushy, especially at the downtown Toronto branches. No real education on TFSA just trying to sell their managed funds!"
1603,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Poor Customer ServiceCustomer service line disconnects after waiting 15 minutes. When I did connect, the rep lied and said I could reset my pin at the ABM, but no option was available nor was it available in my app.Limited hours only 9-4pm. Guess this is a no frills bank. Little to no customer serviceBe careful if you're trying to get money out of this bank. It's like they're operating back in the 90s"
1604,Trust Pilot ,NA,25 minutes on hold to talk with someone from Mexico who barely understood my request... they put me on hold for another 15 minutes to ask four other people before hanging up on me.  I don't remember setting up a bank account in Mexico or asking to be served in Spanish.  and good luck getting ahold of someone at the branch level.  Congratulations to Scotia Bank for making almost every experience as painful as possible.
1605,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Organized thieves, cant justify their actions. Refuse to give any kind of documentation to explain. After meeting in person was assured my file would be investigated by the manager however no response after two months. Now they will not return phone call inquiries. Over 20 years with this bank and they dont seem to care about anything but getting your money for ficticous reasons. Run dont walk,while you can."
1606,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I called customer service to report fraudulent activity related to my VISA card. A young woman answered who had very weak English. She misinterpreted what I said and then proceeded to argue with me that the activity wasn't fraudulent. After a 5 minute argument I hung up. I started banking with Scotia almost 50 years ago and have slowly been moving away in recent years, moving my business to others a little at a time. After this latest fiasco, it's time to move on completely. There are far better options in the marketplace."
1607,Trust Pilot ,NA,"This site is so horrible I am seriously thinking to moving to NB or Desjarins. New site is clunky, missing key areas I used on the old site and horrible navigation.  All this and you pay $9.99/trade when others have free trades.  Bottom line stay away."
1608,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Appalling automatic phone service leads you through a tortuous labyrinth of punch this then that then this again. The numbers and cell phone numbers provided for financial advisor assigned to my account or to branch assistant are not answered nor can a message be left .No direct number for the branch is provided. You would think that a bank making such astronomical profits could afford more customer service people.Horrible  ,horrible mediocrity."
1609,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I was thinking about looking for a new bank. My wife saw an ad from Scotia bank advertising a $350 bonus for signing up. All you had to do was pay a couple of bills first for 3 months then it changed to 6 months. I did all that was required plus I took out a credit card. After 9 months I went in to the bank enquiring about my cash. I could tell right away that I was in for a run around even though on the previous Saturday a teller said I had fulfilled my obligation. When it came time to pay Scotia bank showed their true colors and lack of honor and integrity. They reminded me of that old commercial where the fisherman is holding out a dollar and he's saying ""you almost got it"" and laughing. This was the bank in New Westminster BC on 6th & 6th. Total waste of time. STAY AWAY!!"
1610,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Found out today that Scotiabank does not finance anything off-grid. They will not finance a home if it is off-grid. Bad for their customers and the environment. A totally outdated policy - look at Tesla, they did it with cars now they are doing it with homes. GET WITH THE TIMES SCOTIABANK UPDATE YOUR POLICIES."
1611,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I went to the Scotiabank and received excellent customer service from Jaitsree.  She was very pleasant, professional, and helped me with my query.I would definitely recommend this bank to others."
1612,Trust Pilot ,NA,Worst bank ever for the mortgage.I have had loan and mortgage with Scotia for 9 years and I have never delay even for a day and always on time. I had to transfer my mortgage from scotia to another bank and I did everything on time and they are giving me penalty for $2860 without telling me I had to inform them if I am not renewing my mortgage. They are saying bank sent the letter but I got no letter from them expect one letter after renewal time that they automatedly renew my contract. They dont care about good customers and easily STEALING your money. Worse customer service ever.
1613,Trust Pilot ,NA,I would not give even a single star. Worst bank I have ever seen in my life. Worst customer service and other services as well. Lots of problems with online banking whether its signing in or changing passwords or adding a new card or anything else. I am frustrated with this bank. As an international student I would suggest not to go with scotia bank instead students should open their account with CIBC as it has better and quick customer service.
1614,Trust Pilot ,NA,My husband was scammed out of the entire funds in his account at a Scotiabank machine. He has a Scotiabank account and card. A stranger told him the machine didn't complete his transaction so he went back and entered his card again to check. He was confused because he received his card back but wanted to double check. Somehow this allowed the scammer to change his account information at the machine and empty his account.Scotiabank said it was his fault so there was nothing they could do. I bank with HSBC and you can only change account information in person at a branch. It is hard to believe that Scotiabank would allow that type of account activity at a bank machine.
1615,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I have been banking with Scotia my entire life. It used to be a great online platform that worked well with small business needs. They however discontinued their integration with Quickbooks and now the bank feed is no longer live, creating additional unnecessary work for record keeping."
1616,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I called Scotiabank customer service to increase my transaction limit to meet my transfer amount. The agents barely understood English and didn't know how to respond. The calls dropped twice, despite me calling from home with full network availability.The manager, Joe, has yet to return my call. My transaction limit still hasn’t been increased to meet my 15K requirement. They suggested using Western Union, which has low transaction rates but higher fees.Another alternative they provided was a wire transfer, but it must be done in-person at the bank. This service is not available online, unlike other banks, and the fees are again very high.Their policies and regulations are not helping customers but seem more focused on profiting at their expense. After 24 years as a Scotiabank customer, I think it’s time to switch banks.When businesses fail to improve their services to meet current and future needs, they end up obsolete, like Noki and BlackB."
1617,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I recently closed my Scotiabank accounts and the process was flawless.  The representatives were very attentive, friendly and processed my request smoothly. I was surprised mainly because I called to close accounts. Thank you Scotiabank telephone customer service."
1618,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Worst bank ever!  RBC , TD , other banks are way better than scotiabank. Example check their mortgage interest rate! Almost 2% different from other bankers.  Rip off and don’t take mortgage from this bank"
1619,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Doesn't matter how much I pay down my credit card, it doesn't update where I am at and only has the current statement total. I have to go through every transaction and +/- from my statement to know how much to put on it. I was $5 short because of calculating my vacation spending money and got hit with interest. It doesn't have a simple $1000 owe, put $500 on it and now you owe $500. I have to wait till next months statement to see the amount. If it was only aimple.math fine, but not when I am adding and having things charged to the account regularly and regularly making payments. My TD account shows the actual total and does the math when I put a payment on it. This is just one more thing that doesn't work for me with Scotiabank."
1620,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I have to grit my teeth every time I go to scotiabank online and see that bank with all the rainbow colors and the "" inclusion makes us all stronger"" notice on top. Poor canada! What a bunch of politically correct posturing crap ! If BNS was really interested in ""inclusion"" they shouldn't have closed the branch in Spanish Ontario. leaving me with an hour long drive to Elloit Lake. To make matters worse you can't phone the bank directly. You have to go through the call center where the english language is barely understood."
1621,Trust Pilot ,NA,I'm not a Scotiabank customer. I left them 30 years ago for abysmal service. However I am at a local bank in Halifax depositing money to a Scotiabank customer. I have been here 15 minutes and there are 11 people waiting in line for service and ONE teller in the whole building! It's hard for me to believe that things are worse now than they were 30 years ago!  Unbelievable how people stay with this bank!
1622,Trust Pilot ,NA,The scotia bank select pay on momentum visa is having IT platform issues that they are unable to resolve. This has been going on for several months but rather than working with customers to help them your told by the escalated customer complaint dept that the issue is theirs but the problem of not being able to use it is yours.  I put a $3100. transaction on this card only for the purpose of being able to pay it off over 24 months with no interest or fees only to find out that due to the IT issue I cannot and will be paying 19.99% int on that money until paid off.
1623,Trust Pilot ,NA,"There is no sense in switching to Scotiabank just because they started the scene program! I can never see what my points are, AND I can never get the catalog to load up. My savings account has disappeared from my mobile banking app more then once, so I couldn't transfer funds from my savings to my chequings and had to proceed to get loans from outside sources, when in fact I can't get a hold of my hard earned money. I would call in to have the issue resolved or at least have them help, and everytime they'd say it's a technical issue, then fix it!! It's my money and I should have access to it anytime!!"
1624,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Please Please please fix your banking  machines...90% of the time they don't allow deposits, or usually halfway through the machine stops working. I should not have to drive around Brampton trying to find a Scotia machine that works to deposit my money"
1625,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Horrible!! The two step verification NEVER works on my cell phone, calling and your on hold for half an hour... From a desktop the two step verification still doesn't work... So basically no way to bank at all with them, why would I want to?"
1626,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I have lived in 4 countries in the last 15 years! Scotiabank is the worst banking service I have received, I am including banks in war torn Sudan. Extremely high turn over rates of employees, you can’t book appointments, awful financial advise! The only reason they remain in business is the oligopoly of Canadian banking."
1627,Trust Pilot ,NA,"If I could rate this bank zero stars I would. The hours are inconvenient for anyone with a job, and the after hours ABMs don’t work; and when the banks are open they are advise only, which is the most useless thing ever since I could call the 1-800 number if I need advise and only go to the bank when I actually need a teller. Which I wouldn’t need if the machine accepted cash properly. Worst bank on earth with the worst customer service and technology. 10/10 recommend everyone find a new bank if you bank with Scotiabank."
1628,Trust Pilot ,NA,"As a newcomer on a permanent residency, Scotia Bank is probably the worst banking companies I could have picked. Alas, my poor luck.  Right from the start and till now Scotia bank has been nothing but a giant big pain in my back. Sorry for the language but the emotions are running high. Their online service, especially over the phone, is as good as not having one. Even for the smallest queries, the ignoramuses taking calls in the Scotia bank would refer me to the nearby branch. I work 10-7, Monday to Saturday so that is practically impossible for me to do so. They put a weeks hold on my properly legit salary cheques. I got to wait for a week just to use my own hard earned money. Their mobile app should be a case study of how not to design a mobile banking app nonetheless of such a big bank. No clarity, nothing. And their staff at the Millwoods Town Centre, Edmonton branch is not only unprofessional, but incapable too. They stereotype you and behave in a borderline racist way. Disgusting. Never expected such a poor banking services in a developed country like Canada. I have been let down in so many ways by this poor excuse of a banking company. Switching to their rival bank soon. Already made my opinion on these imbeciles clear on Twitter and Facebook too. They need to be called out! Horrendous!!"
1629,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I never write negative complaints, but as of today, I'll 100% never bank with Scotiabank again. We paid a car loan through Scotia for over two years (at 8.99% interest) and managed end of last month to pay off the remaining balance. We paid the payout amount exactly as per the stated amount in our banking portal.Apparently we still owed $0.71. Instead of advising us or writing off that incremental amount, Scotiabank proceeded to charge us a $40 fee!Having called within a week of paying off the vehicle to confirm that the loan was fully paid, I found out about the bogus charge and asked that it be reversed. The first person didn't set up a case number so Scotiabank started to hound us. I called again and asked that the fee be reversed. This time they set up a case but wihtin a few days, our request was declined. This is the poorest customer service I've ever seen in my life, and I'd consider Scotiabank to be, without doubt, the worst of the major Canadian banks. I'd rather keep my money under my mattress than have them rob us any further."
1630,Trust Pilot ,NA,The most condescending investment people I have ever dealt with in 50 years. Bank people selling bank products for the banks interest. nothing more. Rude and uneducated in investments other than what they try to sell .  Failure to agree results in ridicule .
1631,Trust Pilot ,NA,My advisor would not return my emails or even call me back after i wanted to redeem some mutual funds in my LIRA which i ended up losing 864.00 after i waited a week to get someone at the branch to do it... so i am moving all my business out of scotia bank to another FI that at least cares about me as a customer.
1632,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Absolutely disgusting and disrespectful with peoples lives and well being Being with SB for 25 years and this year they start refunded checks because of their app not seeing clear pictures ( all the checks were acknowledged as deposited and founds in the account )No apologies , they charged for non payments  because not enough founds -their fault not mine -got to go to the branch every time , calls to customer service and nothing not even an apology ...almost forgot all what I get was to go to the teller and deposit the checks . I'm asking myself and asking all of you who will read this why am I paying monthly fees ( $16.99) account maintenance if I cannot use the app , I cannot make an on line deposit and I have to deal with them every time ( 2 hours at least ) to clear all the issues .Shame on SB and their management and their way of doing business.Unfortunately I am tied with a mortgage and banking accounts so I will have to get through for another 2 years with these peoples."
1633,Trust Pilot ,NA,I called I forgot his name coz someone did a cheque transaction of my account and it's very weird coz they are hiring people who doesn't even know their job. I thought he can open my account and can check because he even asked my card number but he keep asking if I did a transaction using my debit card. Even told him no. Then he just advise me to go to my bank and bring 2 pcs of ID coz they can't check if the transaction is a cheque. Advise if their is a fraud or scam using your account in Scotia don't call their fraud customer service go straight to the bank. This people are useless.
1634,Trust Pilot ,NA,"There is no way to do e-transfers other than interac.If your interac is set as your Scotiabank acct and you want to transfer yourself some money to another account, or transfer to someone without interac, you have to go in to a branch and WIRE IT like youre in the 1940's! Not sure if this is a scotia-specific problem or a canada-wide problem but coming from Australia where you can do whatever you need online, this feels insane."
1635,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Nothing but a run around. Call CENTRE said I had to go to the branch in Peterborough. They made an appointment for me and called me the day before to ask what I needed to be do. I explained what was needed.When I went to the branch today. Hunter Street, seen Kate.She said nothing they could do.Was asking about an interest loan rate and all as I got was the run around.I mostly deal with the TD and now I know why. Way better service at TD.If you are looking for a bank Look elsewhere"
1636,Trust Pilot ,NA,First of all poor costumer service . Second they block the account without any notice. Third sometimes you don't have access to the mobile banking app. Overall its a cheap bank only frustrating people.
1637,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Clients should be made aware that Scotiabank's 12 month ""no Interest"" (visa) offer ends up being a scam. You are given the offer that clearly says if the amount borrowed is paid in full within 12 months you will not be charged interest, so you pay this amount as per your agreement, in full and on time. What you are not told is that, if there is any other balance owing (ie you took advantage of a later second no interest offer) that only a portion of your payment goes toward the no interest amount due, and the rest goes to pay towards a different amount, ie the amount that isn't due for months from now. Then what happens? You now have to pay 22.9% on the balance that you thought you paid off. This should have been explained up front so an intelligent decision could have been made, not to accept the offer!"
1638,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Don’t fall for their promises, they lured me in with great expectations of their flex line for small businesses. I jumped through all their hoops, had to get family involved, a lot of Lawyer fees, to submit my application for the flex line that they verbally told me was a sure thing. I zeroed out all my available cash to pay off any outstanding balances. And then they denied me! They were more interested in writing me a mortgage at 6% for a property that I own mortgage free, before they would issue the flexline, which would have no value, because of the mortgage they wanted to write for me.  Liars, left me hanging large!  A neighbour of mine had the similar experience with them."
1639,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Unprofessional and untrained customer service. Rep don't have Knowledge about banking features and product. Very disappointed, long 30 to 40 mins waiting for call center and when they picked call, none was helping, only waste of time."
1640,Trust Pilot ,NA,Garbage bank. I cannot get a credit card a tfsa or overdraft with a credit score of 854. Their bank app does not work. They have started reversing my property tax payments and now I am being fined by the city. Avoid this bank at all costs. They also hold all deposits including cash for over 10 days. Zero customer service
1641,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I have had a number of problems banking with Scotiabank over the past two years. Account withdrawals from one branch to another in Euros is impossible. Customer service is lousy: tellers are frequently busy and when you offer to come back another time to get foreign currency they do not serve you when you return, but make your wait in line to start the whole process over again. Credit card application for a Passport card was approved then cancelled by the branch for no apparent reason. Luckily, I bank at other banks and investment firms and have other credit cards including US-based cards. Lately, I am unable to log into Scotia bank despite providing the correct password, as well as code sent to my mobile.  I must get around to moving my funds out of Scotiabank. I recommend you bank elsewhere."
1642,Trust Pilot ,NA,This bank is a joke when it comes to their respected clients. Being their client means you are just there for them to make money of you. They don't have your back.  Within a month this bank cost me almost 5000$ . Without any concern for their client. Instead of having my back they took a person whom is not a customer of theirs back . Even with proof and evidence showing that they are doing me wrong.  This is why I would never ever keep money in their account. Just so you know. Wanna hear my story about it contact me. polegromark it's a Gmail dot com
1643,Trust Pilot ,NA,I've been banking with scotiabank for years. A new manager started at pilot sound bank. She is the worst. I get a pension from the states. The bank only let's me have $200 and holds the rest for 20 days.  So I never have enough to cover bills as I  live on a fixed income. The bank don't care I'm falling behind on bills cause of this hold. This is the second month they are doing this to me. The worst customer service ever.
1644,Trust Pilot ,NA,Just a useless bank all the way around. My local branch is closed from 11:30 am to 1:00 pm every business day and the tellers then close at 3:00 pm. I'm switching to another bank after the pay deposit fiasco today. I'm done!!
1645,Trust Pilot ,NA,LATEST SCAM IS DO NOT CLICK ON TRANS UNION WHEN YOU SIGN ON TO YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNT.  APPARENTLY BY CLICKING ON TRANSUNION I SOMEHOW ENROLLED IN A $30/MONTH CREDIT MONITORING SERVICE.  I NEVER SIGNED UP FOR THIS! DO NOT CLICK ON IT.  IT'S A SCAM!
1646,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I was clearly robbed from 720 Le Corbusier almost two years ago. They had me arrested for fraud, took my debit card with $391,000 in it. Tried saying I was a fraud. That was January 17, 2023 then Febuary 20, 2023 the police told me everything was alright and referred me back to Scotiabank for my accounts. Do you know I'm still fighting and waiting for my debit card and money. Out of $ 391,000 I admit I spent around $50,000 before they took my account away. But the problem is now they say with thier corrections I only have $144,000 left in that account. So basically they're trying to steal right from under my nose by law almost $200,000. I beg you please don't have anything to do with Scotiabank. I've almost starved for real three times now. It's gauranted ran by bikers."
1647,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Just another bigger than life bank. They show a good front with their marketing but have nothing to back it up. I was a Scotiabank customer for 20 years, but with their new found fame through movies and scene points at grocery stores, the customer no longer matters. This has been a sad transition to a bank like TD and Royal. They will not get my business and you should direct yours to someone else as well."
1648,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Most car loans I've always had buying off a lot deal has been with the Scotia Bank. I finished paying a 8 year no interest loan last September never defaulting or missing a payment. What really gets my goat is after my last payment I never recieved a Thank you for your business, or any notification in 8 years to make me think I was even a customer. This was the same case when Covid and they held off my payments because of my finances. It was very nice but they slammed me with interest for that time. So my loan dragged out to 9 years and no communication from Scotiabank. Guess they were done with me although my phone rang with marketer's asking if I wanted a Scotiabank visa card.  1 star for NO communication with me as a customer in almost 9 years."
1649,Trust Pilot ,NA,TotAly usless customer service. Not one of them has the same answer to any problem you have. Most of them don't understand English so put yourself on repetitive mode.
1650,Trust Pilot ,NA,"They really messed up. They took forever to deposit my funds into my’A   s   l   l   c    account, causing me to miss out on a great opportunity. It’s a good thing I moved out most of my money sooner. I will definitely find a better for company to manage my money."
1651,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I have reached out to Scotiabank on multiple occasions and met with some of their representatives and they were quite nice. BUT when it came to follow up and actual substance all those nice things quickly evaporated. I withdrew my funds and went into the branch as instructed by a Scotiabank representative to close my 2 accts and had 1 closed successfully, then upon closing the other account the clerk stated there was a FEE owing for March 2024. I told her that i talked with a rep on the phone and she instructed me what to do, i had the minimum balance not to pay the monthly but then when i happen to be closing it they hit me with the fee. I told them NO im not paying it, and i havent been allowed to close that acct yet. Im waiting days now for a Rep to call me about my complaints. My guess is their delaying to collect another fee, LOL !!"
1652,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I called visa to put a hold on my credit card of 40 plus years , agent said when I’m ready to call and reinstate it , I did that and they cancelled my card and I have to wait 2 weeks for a new card !!! I didn’t cancel my card only put it on hold ,, they cancelled my card!! Bad bad service"
1653,Trust Pilot ,NA,I called this morning and talked to the manager  Issac badge number is VA 22145  the call centre . He was very rude and very unprofessional on the phone. He didn’t even ask me what my concern was and told me that he can’t help me . I gave him all the information about me and that I have an account with Scotia bank . He didn’t even care to listen to my concern. I will cancel all my accounts with scotia bank and go to another bank who are willing to help
1654,Trust Pilot ,NA,Changed my device and was locked out of online banking. It takes forever to talk to someone on the phone from customer service to help with this so I visited the branch. All that was wrong with my account was the verification of my identity. I was at the branch with all my IDs including my passport and they told me I had to call the number where it takes forever to talk to someone so that they can verify my identity on the phone... because they can't possibly verify my identity PERSONALLY.
1655,Trust Pilot ,NA,"The Scotiabank app is horrible.  I don't know how many times I've tried to get into my savings account or pay a bill and the app tells me I have to open an account.   Right now I have NO ACCESS to my MONEY at 5pm on a Sunday because of ""maintenance."" I'm standing outside Walmart about to grocery shop and have no access to my savings account, the only money I had.  I put this money aside for groceries and now can not use it!!  FIX THIS HORRIBLE POLICY!!"
1656,Trust Pilot ,NA,Customer service is rude. Do not call the 1800  number. You give them all your information and they say its not you. Do not use this bank. I cannot get into online banking no matter what device I use. Do not go to this bank they are rude and disrespectful time to change banks!
1657,Trust Pilot ,NA,"The app can't even verify me with my phone number. I had to reset the app today. It wouldn't allow me to sign in. It wouldn't allow me to sign in on my laptop either. Two step verification doesn't even work. I would give this zero stars if i could. Their update on their mobile app was horrible too. They made it more convoluted and messy looking. I liked the old one better. It was simpler. I tried calling in to their customer service just now and it's at least a 45 min wait! I just want to sign in to my app like i've always done. Just today, it wants to give me a hard time."
1658,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotia block my card after I tried paying a phone bill online then when I call customer service no help pure run around.  To cut a long story short, when I decided to close my account with them, they block me from my account telling me to contact customer service. All because I am not in Jamaica but believe you me, I have had it with them, and I am done with them. One way or the other I am closing my account for good. Too much stress!!!!!!! Every time I call them, they put me on hold forever then redirect me to email instructing me to fill out a form online. I am so frustrated with them and their nonsense. Every time I call customer service is a different story and I'm still not getting anywhere with them. Customer service is very, very POOR!!!!!! I'm SICK of Scotia bank and their foolishness."
1659,Trust Pilot ,NA,"If I can rate 0 star. It is. Waiting ONE hour. Please continue to hold. Oh common. When you get money in my ACCOUNT speeds like tornado as fast. When I need help what happened is that very simple things I need specific.the account loan is fully paid write down the amount that is already paid. And you sent email and not even completed,COMMON” I hate to say this but.DO your job right"
1660,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Good Day.I opened an account at scotiabank AV Constituyentes ESQ 10.  There process is to sign on to there Scotia App ScotiaMóvil and request a e-Token.  It is suppose to take 2 minutes.  I have been trying to get this token since Jan 2nd 2024, it is now Jan 19th.  All i hear is wait 24 hrs followed by wait 72 hrs.  If you want a bank that supports their clients don't go to ScotiaBank."
1661,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Worst bank I have ever dealt with, they are keep reducing my credit card limit without my consent. I occasionally transfer money to my other bank accounts as I have owned my own business and I have multiple bank accounts, if I happened to transfer money to my other bank accounts via scotia bank transfers taking forever to reach."
1662,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Terrible bank for businesses. Scotia bank will hold all paper cheque deposits for the maximum amount of time regardless how long the company has done business, or the amount of volume. The call centre states that you need to build a relationship with the branch manager and small business advisor.  The advisor at the branch states that comment is a lie and the call centre is scripted to say that. The small business advisor stated they can loose their jobs if they don't place a hold on deposits and the most they are authorized to release is 5000.00. When your business does excess of 2million annually with Scotia bank and the best the can do is 5000. I have had up to 86000 of revenue on hold and the bank has bounced my auto payments. Been with this bank for over 15 years.. Time to move on.."
1663,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotiabank was not able to tell me when a charge was put through to my account by a payee (only that there was a 24 hour window); then told me if I put the money in that day I would probably not be charged an NSF fee of $48 and if I was to be charged this fee, the bank would reverse it.  The bank charged me and then refused to reverse it.  Very poor customer service & I would highly recommend dealing with different bank for better customer service."
1664,Trust Pilot ,NA,Stole 200$ out of my account because of some fine print I signed when I signed up. Wouldn't pay it back. Plus they lock me out of my account everytime I try to sign in
1665,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I contacted Scotiabank support and investigation regarding someone adding my credit card to his Apple Pay and paying with it in Alberta (I live and have been in Ontario this entire time. Transactions show that  money was withdrawn from the card simultaneously in different provinces on the same day).  At the same time, I didn’t leave my credit card information to anyone and I don’t even use Apple Pay or an iPhone, I have a Sumsung. Moreover, it is impossible to add a credit card to Apple Pay without confirmation from the bank, which means it is Scotia bank's fault.  I'm surprised how the bank confirmed the addition of my credit card to someone's Apple Pay and still can't answer who it sent the confirmation to. The bank promised to conduct an investigation and return the money within a month.  More than a month has passed, but I still have not received any news from your bank.  It's good that I have a limit on my Schotiabank credit card.  I don't consider this bank safe!"
1666,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I had just opened an account at Scotiabank and after only 4 HOURS they closed my account and took my card then told me that I was terminated and no longer able to bank with Scoitabank ever again... And to boot they won't give an answer as to why and not one person at the bank or there customer service could answer my question of why, would not recommend what so ever choose TD bank over Scotiabank"
1667,Trust Pilot ,NA,Reported lost credit card and was told card was locked Nov 1 2023Transactions went through for another monthCalled many times from out of country w cost of many dollarsNo cancellation of charges as promised so cancelled card and was charged w interestBut bns stockIn 1 year when they figure it outBut do not bank w themI have been a large customer for 45 yearsBut moved onGood luck bnsYou need it
1668,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I was NOT IMPRESSED with the customer service at the Dundas and Appleby location in Burlington. I will NOT be investing any money here in the future. I went in to deposit an inheritance cheque, a 6 figure amount. After the hold was released, I went in to withdraw the amount,and the manager asked me ""Who died"" and ""What am I going to do with the money,"" the former being an incredibly inconsiderate and disrespectful question. When I took the cheque to an outside investment advisor, the ink was too light to even be read by the scanner, and I had to go BACK to Scotiabank to reissue a NEW cheque. They told me it is not their fault as their printer doesn't have ink....so I had to put the money back into my account and waIt ANOTHER 5 business days to take it out and wire it to my outside investor.I will NOT BE investing anything at Scotiabank and I'm VERY happy that I did not proceed with a TFSA or RRSP there."
1669,Trust Pilot ,NA,"DO NOT GO WITH SCOTIABANK ! I WOULD MOVE ALL MY BUISNESS !! Carla Bunch the NOW former Manager of the Lower Sackville, NS Branch went on a power trip and closed customer's account before leaving ! NO WARNING NO NOTICE !!!HAPPY NEW YEARS TO ME !!!!  KARMA IS GOING TO FIND YOU !"
1670,Trust Pilot ,NA,"THE WORST!!!people at the beach are the only saving grace of this bank.The call centre has been a monstrous experience. Rude staff who refuse to transfer you to a manager.Save yourself and choose, LITERALLY any other bank!!"
1671,Trust Pilot ,NA,After having a terrible experience with the experience manager of all people I sent an email to the branch manager who logged the complaint but fabricated the story saying things that just didn’t take place in the interaction with experience manager. I replied thanking him for the logged complaint but pointed out that the comments his experience manager claimed just weren’t what happened. I then asked him to work with me to rectify the problem rather than just logging a complaint. He then went and wrote a letter saying the bank is ending thier business relationship with me. This is absurd he logged a complaint so then when I ask for apology they threaten to close down accounts.Very unprofessional team at Scotiabank london Southdale Kevin Stover the branch manager is extremely unprofessional and handles this very poorly so we closed all of our accounts after reading his letter that was clearly him trying to bully us. Don’t bank here it’s atrociously unprofessional and extremely rigid policies. The manager and the experience manager both have terrible attitudes for customer service.
1672,Trust Pilot ,NA,Terrible. Ask for an annual statment for my car loan and they said 10 business days through mail. And if I dont received it i need to request again and it would take another 10 business days!!!!!!!!!!!! As it is more secure- how mail can be secure?????Just place in to my account. My last business with this bank.
1673,Trust Pilot ,NA,"The Scotia bank 885 Lawrence ave east has the worst bank machines. Can’t withdraw money, can’t make bill payments. Sometimes I withdraw cash to pay my visa, and the machine doesn’t except the cash that was just withdrawn."
1674,Trust Pilot ,NA,"How the hell in 2024, I can't transfer money to other bank accounts within Canada online? Do I need to go to a bank like a medieval area? No thanks, I am coming to close everything with this bank. ( And need to stand with attitude of that lady in the branch)"
1675,Trust Pilot ,NA,"It feels like Scotia Bank is not at all interested in having valuable customers. Recently I had an issue with a wire to my account which has happened the 2nd time, so I brought this complaint up to the branch manager and with frustration I told her that I’m considering moving my money and investments to CIBC, her response to this was that she can help me send all my money to CIBC which felt like Scotia is not interested in assisting customers and keeping their business. The previous manager who took care of my past issues with Scotia Bank was highly professional and was kind enough to solve my problem and understood how frustrating the loss of someone’s money is."
1676,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Experienced confidentiality issues with an employee of Scotia Bank The Pas/OCN.  I sent a private text message to the executer of a familial estate in regards to some financial issues.  Shortly after I went over to the branch to ask a few questions, not regarding the text, I realized by the reactions of some of the employees when they saw me standing or heard me at customer service that this particular private text had been sent to a long time employee by the executor and that she had either shown or spoke of this text.  After 30 years at this branch of Scotia Bank I have decided to move my finances and those of family to another Financial Institution.  I think any kind of professional breach should end with termination of their job.  I know this won’t happen, so for my own peace of mind, considering it will probably happen again I will move on."
1677,Trust Pilot ,NA,Absolutely horrible - found out that Scotiabank was 'selling' my wife's information to a 3rd party without her authorization. My wife was receiving calls in the evening from a rep who wanted to discuss life insurance after she had opened a GIC and deposit. After I traced the call found the company was operated as a subsidiary of Scotiabank. My wife immediately emailed a complaint to Scotiabank notifying that a complaint with the Privacy Commissioner of Ontario would commence if further calls received infringing on my privacy. On going issue of cashing in a redeemable GIC - these people were not hired as financial advisors in addition refusing to release a redeemable GIC. Unbelievable.
1678,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I had requesed that my rsp funds be transferred out of Scotia Bank to another institution. The institution that sent the transfer request had contacted Scotia Bank numerous times that they had not recieved the funds and to send them over. After 40 days, I was informed that Scotia Bank had not sent the money, so I called them up. The Investment agent I spoke to said that the reason that the transfer did not take place and had been rejected is that the value amount on the transfer request did not match the exact value amount in the account, even though the request was for the ntire value of the account, and that a new request would be required. The interest being paid on the transfer account at Scotia Bank is 0.0100% in the mean time. It leaves me to wonder if this is a case of incompetance are down right crookedness."
1679,Trust Pilot ,NA,"My wife and I were initially motivated to open an account in order to obtain a travel credit card, specifically the VISA Passport Infinite with no foreign exchange fees. Although this bank ranks poor in many aspects I only want to write about the latest disappointment. Their chosen insurer for credit card services is Manulife, a despicable company in its own right. Together with Scotiabank they have chosen to not compensate victims of the political gamesmanship with India. India suddenly stopped issuing visas to all Canadians leaving those who had purchased an airline ticket to or from India in advance, up the proverbial creek without a paddle. Clearly an insurable event but a decision was made to cheat clients based on unrelated wording in the agreement. When we return to Canada we will be closing our account."
1680,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Terrible first impression. Could barely get through to speak to someone. Seems like I'm asking them for a favor to open up accounts. I have banking history with BMO, TD, and RBC. Scotia seems like they don't want your business or at least they will make it seem like that. Even if you are with them, they are hard to reach and will misinform you."
1681,Trust Pilot ,NA,Consistently being told to go to the branch when calling into the fraud department for unauthorized transactions. What’s the point of customer service. If I could rate a 0 I would.
1682,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotiabank are crook, staff doesn't look at it how they double charge interest on my line of credit. I pay it full but still at the end they still chargw more interest. Never ever do it again with them as they just want money from us."
1683,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Don't even wanna leave one star. Thanks to this banks weird account updates and not letting you access your accounts during them. Last week there was an update going on all day. Of course, the day my insurance comes out. I checked all day. Couldn't access my savings account. I needed to transfer money to my chequing from my savings account to pay my bill. I keep my money in my savings because I've had security issues with scotia in the past and they recommended the idea to me. So, I wasn't able to access my bank until literally the next day. Once I finally was able to transfer money I realized two days later that it had bounced. So $48 fee from scotia and $50 from my insurance. These updates happen so frequently. Yes on the weekends and late at night/early morning usually, but sometimes not. I'm really getting tired of my issues with scotia bank and the app itself and I want to leave but they want to charge me $100 just to close my account. Go to any other bank."
1684,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Wish I could give 0 stars. Blocked my card while travelling abroad. Their toll free number on the credit card did not work. Finally got through from ANOTHER number online. Was on an hour call with their customer service internationally. Got told I had to go to a branch to confirm my IDs. Since this awful bank has no rep in Europe, I had to wait until I got home. Went to a branch with my IDs. Got told I had to call the number on my credit card after. Wasted another hour just to be told I had to go to my home branch that I never knew about. After wasting DAYS and HOURS of my life, the issue is still not resolved. Do you guys even want me to pay off my card? I’m just trying to pay it but can’t even access my account."
1685,Trust Pilot ,NA,This bank is a nightmare. I been with them for over 20 years and lately having nothing but issues . They keep your money hostage. You get a government cheque if it's Ontario they hold it for 5 days. My husband gotten EI and it was on hold. I can't make my bills by all this holding cheques. And have to go different channels to get money that I put in a neutral funds. Or wait for days for an appointment to get my money is rediclous. Like I said I feel my money is hostage. And this bank makes me fall behind on bills.now that I have over bills 2000. They won't let me use my debit to pay it . With a low limit on my depit card .
1686,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I have credit cards with Scotiabank but no other services since I discharged my mortgage and line of credit.  Because of this I cannot do online banking.  Towards the end of a trip to Australia my Scotiabank visa was refused several times. Since I was almost ready to come home I thought I would wait to resolve the situation.  Today I've just had to make several different calls--the number on my card did not work, the number I looked up on line did not work, etc...The only voice I heard was automated--offering my a deal on a medical alarm device if I was eligible.  When I refused my line was disconnected instead of transferred. Then I was given a 4 digit number with the # sign to call--that didn't work either.  Finally I had to get out my paper bill to get a number from there.  Then I had to wait 10 minutes. There is more--but I don't want you to die of boredom! If I had tried to resolve this from Australia I would have been doomed!  As it is, the situation is still not resolved and I have cut up my cards!  What happened to the notifications if there was a transaction on my card?  what happened to commonsense security?  I can never get that time back and am absolutely furious.  Several million thumbs down."
1687,Trust Pilot ,NA,Worst bank ever been there 30 years will leave and take my mortgage elsewhere. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE
1688,Trust Pilot ,NA,This bank is double charging interest and ripping off client when I borrow money in my line of credit. Will never used this bank again.
1689,Trust Pilot ,NA,Where is my damn paycheck Never as this happened to me The least u guys can do is give some kinda compensation but  nothing Last time I am dealing with this bank
1690,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Useless bank. They sent a card to my old address, but I can't login to the website to change the address and it tells me to call. I call them and they tell me to go into the branch. I don't even know why I have an account with them, but at this point I just want to close it and move on with my life."
1691,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Went to my branch (10years)\. New people. I went to make a cash withdraw of $2800. First thing they said was ""May we ask what is this money for?"". I said ""None of your business!"" Then I was asked to enter my PIN. OK. Then asked to see my ID. OK its a big cash amount, so I show my ID. Then they asked for my signature, my Mothers maiden name, something else. I said whats going on here??? I put in my pin, I showed my ID why am I being interrogated to take funds out of my own account???  ""This is our policy Sir. Its always been there, we just had the option not to ask for all the proofs of verification before, but now we have to.""SCOTIA BANK IS SYSTEMATICALLY TRYING TO CLOSE ALL IN PERSON BRANCHES AND MAKING IT AS DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE AS POSSIBLE TO USE A BRANCH AND TELLER. BYE BYE SCOTIA I AM FINISHED WITH YOUWHAT AN ABSOLUTE EVIL SINISTER COMPANY!!!!"
1692,Trust Pilot ,NA,"The WORST Bank in Canada. I'm not surprised to see 1.4 star review. They're losing money and desperate to get people's money.We had missed 2 car loan payments only because the mobile cheques deposited didn't go through right away. There was a hold. They NEVER gave us a call, email or registered mail to let us know that they will transfer it to 3rd party collection.   Our son's car was towed out of our driveway WITHOUT notice whatsoever. We actually thought it was stolen. We had to call the police to report.When i called Scotiabank ask for correspondence made to us, they DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING on file to prove that they even mailed us or emailed us or even called us to let us know of missed payments and that it will be sent to 3rd party if we didn't settle owing.  Had we known,  we would have rectified it asap. The person I talked to couldnt even tell me when I was called. When emails or mails were sent.NO PROOF. If we had known this sooner, there's no way that we would not settle this asap.All they said was I can file a complaint.$2000 of extra charges later just to get our son's car back. All because of inefficiency and negligence on their part. No courtesy to their customers. They do not deserve the people's business.NEVER Deal with SCOTIABANK!!!We always deal with Royal Bank for 30 years and we NEVER had experienced anything like this.Communication system with RBC is excellent while Scotiabank is POOOR. Shame on you!They do not even deserve a 1 STAR!"
1693,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Avoid Scotiabank at all costs!!!Do not use Scotiabank.  The worst of the bunch, Claims to be ethical,  but it is anything but. I have been a staff and a customer for the past 30 years, but I will move to another bank as soon as I can."
1694,Trust Pilot ,NA,Another really long line up and only 2 customer service reps. 1 manager not helping and it's but the lunch hour.
1695,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Phoned 2 weeks ago to get a bak card with my name on it, was told I would get it in 5 business days. 10 business days have gone by and no card. Phoned again and was told it was sent to old address. I updated my address 5 months ago at the branch, and they cant update it when you phone. So have to go back to the branch apparently to update address again. Bologne!!! My son in law went through the same thing, but he requested new card with name on it from the branch and it took 2 and a half months for him to get his, and couldn't use his account for some things for that time. S"
1696,Trust Pilot ,NA,Very bad service by a guy working in the credit card solution department. He talked to me so rudely.
1697,Trust Pilot ,NA,Worst service by Scotia Bank
1698,Trust Pilot ,NA,"In Scotiabank's wisdom, and to save a buck, they outsource their customer service to a foreign country. To add more insult, they hire customer service representatives who speak poor English. What exceptionally intelligent person came up with this idea?"
1699,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I Liked their customer service, very helpful and attentive, thank you."
1700,Trust Pilot ,NA,"The wait time is pathetic when you call their online customer service, it's min 30 mins wait time...how can one have that long wait time in today's world"
1701,Trust Pilot ,NA,"On April 4 I proceeded to make my CEBA payment as scheduled.On April 5 I went to verify payment only to find my Business account has been frozen. Same day I went to Scotia bank, 470 Charlemagne Blvd to inquire as to the issue.The bank manager saw me promptly to look into the issue but nothing could be done as there were no notes attached to the file ( Notes are required as per Bank policy ) so left unresolved.I myself contacted CRA and found the freeze was not initiated by CRA nor RQ.On April 9 I went the another Scotia bank 3888 Innes Rd to inquire. The Bank Manager mr. Iyak Onyeagwu saw me straight away and asked how much time I had as he would get to the bottom of the issue. In the 2hrs 30 min that followed he had spoked at least 6 different departments and traced the freeze to Scotia Bank, Green ave, Montreal and promptly contacted them. The Business manager stated there were no notes attached and could do nothing. Again.Expressing his frustration mr. Iyak Onyeagwu proceeded to engage with the manager at Scotia Montreal who just repeated there was nothing he could do as again there are no notes attached. Mr. Iyak Onyeagwu again expressed his frustration to the manager who stated he would not remove the freeze as he could not determine why the freeze was in place.As of May 2 2024 there has been no update, no contact and No resolve. I have not even been notified that the account has been frozen.Currently automatic withdrawal payments are being returned.Payments to CRA, BDC, telecommunications, Equipment are ALL bouncing as well as my credit score being affected.Is this the state of the Canada Banking system as where only ONE person is willing to take responsibility and is forced to deal with half a dozen people who don’t.No Accountability, Sincerely, Robert Alaous"
1702,Trust Pilot ,NA,"We were defrauded in Cabo San Lucas by car rental company U-Save Car & Truck Rental (usave.com) on Feb. 5/23 in the amount of $965. M/L on our Scotiabank AmEx credit card. The charge was unauthorized; Scotiabank does not have a record of the transaction or an imprint of the card. At the start of the 28 day rental U-Save put a Hold on our acct., which is customary for rentals. There were 2 items that were fraudulent charges, the rental rate and an additional liability insurance charge of US$420. A reservation confirmation with rates and insurance being noted as optional was submitted with our docs. Scotiabank (ECCO dept and CCAO) asserted we fully authorized the charge when in fact we were not present at U-Save on Feb. 5/23, nor was the credit card. SB claimed they could not investigate because there was no final receipt. OBVIOUSLY, we do not have a final receipt because Scotiabank has NO record of the transaction. We did NOT AUTHORIZE the merchant to charge our card.  For over a year we requested a final receipt from SB but they never even addressed the matter. Escalated to ECCO & CCAO, and then ADRBO (which is a joke, but they are no longer a consumer ombudsman in Canada effective Nov.1 thankfully). Got the same answer right down the line. Scotia disregarded or lost our complaint file for 117 days and will not acknowledge it! Fed. Gov't gives banks 56 days. FCAC now investigating - we hope. Scotia claims in their Banking Companion Booklet and on their website that the Scotiabank AmEx card is covered by the ""American Express Fraud Protection Guarantee"", which is a FALSE representation. A lie! Four AmEx agents over the past year have said they cannot investigate (apparently whether they'd determine fraud or not) due to their SB AmEx card being only a ""PARTNER"" card. Their agents will not comment about AmEx being the credit card network payment operator for Scotia. (SB is the only Canadian bank to issue an AmEx card in Canada other than AmEx itself.) In other words, Scotia authorized the fraudulent charge presumably. All phone agents for SB are offshore. An agent in South Africa confirmed this past March the lack of a record of our transaction and an imprint of our c/card. Took her 15 mins what SB Canada (Toronto) would not do in over a year! Never encountered such incompetence and lack of business ethics, principles and morals. That applies to both usave.com and Scotiabank!"
1703,Trust Pilot ,NA,Been a customer for over 10 years and they held my work check even tho I told them I needed it for food so been with out food for 4dayz now
1704,Trust Pilot ,NA,"This bank is a joke. They hold your access to your money. In my case, savings, that is needed. ""due to their maintenence"". When asked how long this would be. I was told 12 hrs. At 6 pm tonight I will have access to my money.I've opened an account with them 5 months ago and this is the 2nd time this has happened. I will never recommend this bank to anyone. I'm just so disappointed and have lost my trust. I will be closing my accounts with this bank."
1705,Trust Pilot ,NA,Incompetence at its finest. Just spoke with supervisor Carlos in the credit card department. Nothing good to say about him or the customer service experience. What a pretentious self serving and uncharacteristically uncaring member of the Scotiabank team. All I wanted was some non account specific information on a particular credit card feature and Carlos felt like he was the gatekeeper to Scotiabank’s riches by making me go through a completely unnecessary account verification. IT WAS NOT ACCOUNT SPECIFIC!!! Customer Service at Banks sucks in general but Carlos sucks a little more!
1706,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Worst bank i've ever been with. You're better off with KOHO. This last year especially has been awful. So many issuesOn numerous occasions i could not access my bank accounts bc of ""system maintences"" that were never communicated prior. And i mean 12-20 hour days of no access to my accounts. Every time its happened i only got info bc i called and was told by a machine. And its happened several times in the last year alone.On a near daily basis for the last few weeks i've been charged an overdraft charge, even with my acc being in good standing/not being in the negatives. I've had to get already a refund on it multiple times, and its totaled over 50$ so far! And stuff like this happens bc there is such a huge delay between when you spend/receive money vs when its actually processed. So you can have 30$ in your acc, but bc between the hours of 6pm and 8am you had less than 10, you'd get a 5$ overdraft charge. This has been a consistent pattern for too long now.As if these arent irritating enough, there's also the paycheque issues. I dont think there is a standard time that paycheques come thru and its ridiculous. NORMALLY its 1am on the day of payday. But sometimes its not until the afternoon that day. Or the evening that day! Why the f is that?Anyway, I recommend anyone looking to switch banks to stay tf away from scotia. It truly is the worst bank in canada. And if you can pull your money, do so. They arent a bank worth investing with. They arent a bank with saving with. They arent even a bank worth having a chequing acc with. I'm not a huge fan of KOHO, but even they were more reliable"
1707,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Very poor customer service, all agents are so arrogant, and not helpful, also workers at rochdale branch are so arrogant also."
1708,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I have been a Scotiabank client for 10+ years. Like ALOT of people, I have struggled at times, BUT I have spent the last 2 1/2 years paying down my debt and paying my bills on time. My current debt load is just under 10k. A big chunk of that is from a loan with an interest rate of 46.9%. I had gotten that loan out of desperation, after we were all crawling out from under the covid pandemic.I have made a $107 payment EVERY SINGLE WEEK since March 2022, and have NEVER missed a payment. I also have my M/C that I pay every month, and have NEVER missed a payment.I have been employed full-time continuously, and have rebuilt my credit from the very low 600’s, to a score of 726 since 2022 (thank you failed marriage and covid for dragging me down).Yes, I had a collection, thanks to Atlas Utilities. When I moved from Morinville to Edmonton in 2022 they sent me final bill, which I paid. 60 days later a collection company said I still owed another $585. It was unexpected to say the least, considering I recieved a “final bill” from @Atlasutilities. I paid the collection off, and thought that blight and burden was closed.On July 12, 2024, after all my hard work and with a credit score of 726,  I had an appointment with a Scotiabank representative with hopes of paying out what is left of my 46.9%  loan….. my application was DECLINED….. bcuz I had “1 or more collections”. It was in that meeting that I learned Scotiabank doesn't actually look at people... they look at screens and numbers.I also learned that @Transunion, or any other credit agency, doesn't automatically update a person's credit file if transactions occur within the last 7 years. Exact words from the Scotiabank rep “yeah, it sucks, you need to call them (TransUnion) and TRY to get it cleared/deleted (expected success rate 0-0.5%).Meanwhile, bcuz Scotiabank did a hard credit check, it is a strike against me, and my credit score will suffer! It has gone from 726 to 715 because of this meeting!!Thanks for nothing Scotiabank!I could be paying you interest instead of the lender of that high interest loan!!!"
1709,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I'm the executor for my mom's estate. I submitted all my paperwork to Scotiabank almost two weeks ago and they have not released the estate's money. In this time, I've tried many, many times to call: Scotiabank's Estate department, the bank where my mom kept her money, the bank where I submitted the paperwork - to inquire as to the status of this transfer. The Estate dept message has stated day after day that the English person in charge is not answering her phone and her mailbox is full. In desperation I called the French line. No answer there either. My mom's bank say they can't reach the estate department either. It often takes 15 or 20 minutes to wend my way through phone service, only to reach a dead end. The one time a human answered, he put me through to someone's voice mail a week ago, and this person didn't return my call. I went to my local Scotiabank to find 12 - 15 people waiting in line for two tellers. There was no receptionist to even answer a question. I left a message asking if I could talk to the representative who had filed my estate papers. Nobody responded. Scotiabank is happily (I suppose) holding hundreds of thousands of dollars of my mom's money, offering us zero interest for many months, but I'm sure making plenty of interest on it, which we will never see. My mom was a faithful customer for many years. What a completely disrespectful way to treat her and her family. At my own credit union, I get prompt, respectful service every time I go in.  It is mindboggling to me how anyone can be allowed to give this non-level of customer service. How do people still tolerate this and keep their accounts at Scotiabank?"
1710,Trust Pilot ,NA,The worst bank ever I have dealt with. They decreased my line if credit without my knowledge. When I called the ask me go to brand and they can increase it. Actually they play game
1711,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Horrible service, horrible customer service, horrible and no professionals in almost all branches.The customer service phone never picked up."

1714,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Tried to access some funds from my retirement LIF and have had nothing but frustration. Took 3 days just to speak to someone I could understand. Being a senior with not-the-best hearing, it was extremely difficult communicating with the representatives heavy accent. After a very frustrating conversation, I was given an appointment at my own branch that's a 10 minute drive away, but only after refusing an appointment at 3 different locations all over an hour away. Having had the same account for over 30 years, I figured I should be entitled to conduct my business at my own branch. After speaking with a financial advisor and getting all the paperwork done, I was told it would be ""2 or 3 days"". Called back to check on progress and was told by said Financial Advisor that all was good and on track, everything was approved and it was just a matter of putting funds where I needed them. I was told they would be in an RRIF overnight and I could access them through the call center next morning.  Called next morning and struggled with another thick accent and was given total runaround. Asked for supervisor and was connected to a department that was closed for the weekend! Called back to attempt to straighten things out again and was given phone number to Revenue Canada, who had no idea of what I was talking about.  Called back Monday to my own branch and F.A. again told me everything was on track and funds would be in play by Tuesday morning. Nothing happened....called branch again and F.A. called back at 5:30 and informed me tat it was being handled and should be straightened out ""by end of day"". When nothing happened I called called center again and spoke to someone in investments who informed me that I couldn't access my funds that way. I called the branch manager ar 9:30 a.m. and explained situation. My call was returned at 5:20 and branch manager said she was just hearing of this now and it would take up to two weeks to access my money. The moment I straighten things out, I am taking my business away from Scotiabank.... would not recommend it to anyone....worst customer service I have ever encountered!"
1715,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I called the bank for fraudulent and ask for card replacement to be send to me as I’m living in nain and flight plus hotel is highly costly it was nightmare to call the bank either both departments customer service or fraud department way unprofessional and zero communication and they cuts off the phone twice ,furthermore they are not answering the calls and if the do so they kept me twice on hold for more than 25 minutes.The funny thing once they answer the call they start funny phrase how can I help you and I will advise not mentioning such phrase anymore coz your not capable to help."

1717,Trust Pilot ,NA,Wish I would have read the reviews firstWhat a terrible client experience DO NOT RECOMEND
1718,Trust Pilot ,NA,"One star isn't deserving of them. I can seriously say that I HATE ScotiaBank, whether it's their customer service, their crappy app, their sign up bonus lies, their overly long wait times or the fact that most other banks release your money on time sometimes even earlier. I might have money coming in on the 28th but BMO would release it 8pm om the 27th.. CIBC has it's momemts where it's similar to BMO but SCOTIA...my God. They will hold on to it for their dear lives.  Even the 3-5 business day policy. I'm used to majority of any other bank that ive been with crediting funds within 2-3 business days... once again, not Scotia. They seem to take the full 5 days. They are just EXTREMELY. Like I cannot stress enough.. EXTREMELY BEYOND annoying to have as my bank. I closed my account 2 weeks ago and I'm happy that I did. But even as I closed my account im still being haunted by them. Hopefully forthe last time. My cheque was wrongfully deposited into my scotia account but it's closed  so it's bouncing back. It happened before when i switched to scotia..but the bank that it bounced from returned it almost instantly..like 2 days later.. it coming from scotia has been 4 days already, and than I'm going to have to wait another 2-3 business days for it to be deposited into the right account. Overall..another bank recieves something that it shouldn't -- they return it to the rightful place almost instantlyScotia recieves money that they shouldn't.. it takes them 5 days to release it. Hence ""they wrongfully hold on to your money with their dear life..""The scene points are attractive and seem appealing but please don't be blinded by the hype. I can promise you that it isn't worth the headache,stress and daily annoyance"

1720,Trust Pilot ,NA,Horrible Customer Service. The simple Credit Card activation process became a nightmare and I was forced to go to a local branch for Credit Card Activation.
1721,Trust Pilot ,NA,"What a run around!! I've been a customer of Scotia bank for over 10 years. I needed to speak to a person at my home branch so I could have my cash back limit increased by a 100. 00.  I so far have made 5 attempts to do this today,plus wasted the majority of my afternoon sitting on hold, and I've still gotten no where.  I'm sitting on hold right now as we speak.  Everytime I try to reach a real person at my home bank, I get redirected to customer support/and or/ the system disconnects because I won't enter in a selection.  I finally thought i was getting somewhere when I had a person at the support center transfer my call directly for me.  It rang and a nice recording came in to tell me that the number was assigned to a voicemail service at Scotia bank but that it was no longer in service.  Then voice on the recording rattled off a number plus an extension for me to call and then call disconnected.  Well, that's lovely isn't it? Was I able to write down all the info? No, of course not.  I got about 2/3rds of the needed info.   I'd love to call the number back and listen to the msg again so I might be able to get the rest of the needed info, HOWEVER, this call was transfered by a customer service rep, so, of course I do not have the phone number that was dialed.  Sooooo ... Only solution left to me now is to call the support centre back yet again and now wait on hold for even a longer period of time. I'm ready to scream my head off.  This is beyond ridiculous!!!!  So! I just got given ext numbers for branch manager and client care, Also, got transfered to my branch.  A recording came on asking for the  ext I'm trying to reach and guess what??  It won't accept either of them. And the call was disconnected yet again. I am so annoyed I think I'll go pull the 1500.00 plus change that I deposit every two weeks and go elsewhere.   This is THE worst customer service I've ever had the displeasure of receiving.  These guys suck big-time."

1725,Trust Pilot ,NA,Customer Service doesnt know their job and not helpful at all.

1735,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I live in another country I just came to Canada for work and I choose Scotiabank so I could use my card easily in my home country too, It has been 2 weeks since I came back to my home country, I tried to use both my debit and credit cards which works sometimes or sometimes it doesnt at all. A week ago I was trying to withdraw some cash from an ABM, the one that I used for 2 weeks, in the first time I coulndt get the money but in my account the money immediately got back in myaccount as correction, so I tried for the 2nd time, did not worked so I thought the money will came back to my account as the first time which did not, I emailed my advisor he told me he couldnt help I emailed Scotiabank and they told me to go to a branch, they do NOT have any branches in my country, I can not fix the issue using online banking or emailing them."
1736,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I don't even know where to begin with how bad my experience with this bank has been this year. First off, in March I received a settlement from a past car accident, and I got it in check form from my lawyer. I went to deposit the check and they told me to use the machines to deposit if I was OK with the check being held until it cleared. As I wasn't desperate for the money, I went ahead and did so. Two days later, I check my account to find that there was a double hold on the check, so I had over $50,000 on hold. I called them to see what was going on as I had just received a paycheck and I needed to pay bills, but this double hold was preventing me from using the paycheck I had earned from working. They told me it would be fully cleared the next day. I said okay, and waited. Woke up the next day, still had the same issue, so I go in to my local branch. I brought in the check and the invoice from my lawyers office, and offered it to them, but they said they didn't need it. They said YET AGAIN that the hold would be gone the next day, and that MY branch just had a delay. By this point I was super frustrated and just left. The next day it STILL was not fixed, but I was unable to go in as I had to work that day, and I had prior important commitments afterwards. After a full week of not having ANY access to my funds, they FINALLY decided to share with me that I was sent to the fraud department and proceeded to lecture me for deposting the check at their ATM machines, even though THEY told me to. So again, I took time away from my job to go in to the bank, with my check. They copied the check, the invoice and a note from my lawyer to send to the fraud department. It wasn't until my lawyer had to call them another two weeks later that the fraud department actually did something. Now on to my recent issue. I recently started working as a model, and I've been making deals with companies. I want to preface this by saying I know I made some wrong moves, but it certainly did not warrent the treatment I received. I was reached out to by an artist who wanted to use one of my photos for a painting. They sent me a check, and it all seemed real. I recognized the company name, and I did research to ensure I had all information before cashing the check. Unfortunately, this did end up being a scam and the check bounced, and again I should have been smarter and not trust it. When I discovered it was a scam and the check bounced I went to the bank right away as my account had been frozen. I had went in, showed them all the information, the conversations, the emails, and the check I received. At first, the lady I was speaking to was really kind and said that she would have believed it as well. Unfortunately, I had moved and I couldn't go to my actual branch, so they couldn't fully fix it until they received a forwarded email from my home branch, which was fair. So I went home when they said they would call me when they received it. A week later they finally call me, but we're not so helpful or supportive. They said hello and verified that I was myself, but that was the end of the pleasantries. They proceeded go tell me that I was stupid for depositing the check, and that they will very likely 'end the relationship'. I've had this account for well over a decade. I've been a loyal customer to them for years. Even getting my first credit card through them, and my home insurance, and in all that time this was my FIRST mistake. Mind you, they have a policy that checks are held for 5 days minus $100, and I did not spend any money of the check. No one lost any money at all. They told me in order to know if I could keep my account, I'd have to go in AGAIN! So I went in the next day yet again. I was greeted with anger and judgement the minute I walked in that building, by people who just 8 days before were agreeing that it looked real and they would have likely fallen for it too. They proceeded to spend 45 minutes lecturing me on internet safety. The whole ""don't give your personal information to anyone on the internet"", in which I didn't. The only information they had was my first name and my business email that has no connection to any of my banking matters. In the end, no one was really hurt by this scam. Yes I need to be more cautious, but at the same time I'm human, and humans make mistakes. The fact that they made me wait so long, and then threatened to drop me was completely unacceptable and honestly rude. I totally understand that they need to protect themselves, but there is no reason to call a young person who made a mistake 'stupid' when their job is to provide assistance and be professional. I will be closing my account with Scotiabank as soon as I have all my direct deposit info updated. They are so rude, imcompent, and unprofessional."

1741,Trust Pilot ,NA,"My wife and I have accounts with Scotiabank. We are really disappointed with how the customer service has decreased in the branch located at 235 Marion St, Winnipeg, Manitoba.A year ago, when we arrived in Canada, we decided to trust Scotiabank to put our savings and do our daily banking. Today, we have decided to switch to another bank as we have had small issues in the past, but today was beyond our limits. Thirteen months ago we opened a GIC investment which matured yesterday, Monday, November 6. Since July, we have been visiting the branch asking for the First Home Saving Account, and also asking about the option of investments in TFSA and RRSP. As we only have the day off on Tuesdays and the maturity date of the GIC was yesterday, we booked an appointment for today, and we will be using that money to reinvest.At the branch, they explained to us that the advisor with whom we made the appointment more than a month ago, was on personal leave a long time ago. We did not choose any advisor in particular, we just booked the appointment using the online system. But if that was the case, we consider that the right thing to do was to reschedule all the appointments of this advisor with the new one working today. As they mentioned, this happened a long time ago, so they were supposed to have an option for clients like us.The other thing was, that we were not able to access our money, in any form, not the money of the matured GIC or the savings in my account. I was looking for a solution which they never offered. The staff at this branch only apologized about it but did not offer us any other option.We called customer services and they were really gentle. We went to RBC and they will be opening all the accounts we need by next week. Today Scotiabank lost 2 more clients and won all the bad references that we can be asked for in the future as we will never recommend this bank to anyone."
1742,Trust Pilot ,NA,"This is my first time writing a review here. I’m sick and tired of rude people on the phone. I understand that people get tired and fed up of their jobs but the rudeness is completely unnecessary. I was redirected multiple times-which I didn’t mind. I’m just mentioning that for future reference. Everyone was kind except for the last person I spoke to. Some rep named “Valen”. Not only was she rushing the conversation but she cut me off multiple times and had an inexcusably rude and irritated tone. She was obnoxious right out of the gate. I was polite to all 5 people I was redirected to, including her. Some patrons would’ve been angry for being sent to 5 different people. I wasn’t, and she was still ill-mannered. I even asked her if she was okay, to which she condescendingly said “yep.” and when I still politely thanked her for her help she hung up abruptly. My problem wasn’t even actually solved. I tried to fix my issue after she hung up. My problem is still not fixed."

So, the dept that approves credit and requires CRA proof, can't read a CRA doc??????????? morons!! Sent a reply with all the attached docs proving nothing owing to CRA.  SILENCE.  BTW secure email service with them is a piece of s83t.  first experience with this bank.  Is my last.  I'll get a CC from another bank, or company.  done with scotia bank"
1745,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I had a very poor experience with a financial advisor at Scotia bank Guildford , Surrey BC Brunch. Fardin S has no ppl skills , he started to initiate something on his own which was never requested.He had no manners, “ no pls & thank you”Will not use his service Ever!"
1746,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Don’t even deserve a star. Since July, automatic payments were made via chequing account. They just don’t F’ing stop harassing me with emails,letters and phone calls about my car loan. Clearly you my payment is due every 16th why are you harassing me 2 weeks prior to my payment? Idiot at the office can’t even find my loan # which is just F’ing ridiculous. Learn to hire some professionals to do your work."
1747,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotia Bank is totally  crap!!! I have a car loan with them. They stopped  taking out automatic  payments. I had to spend half an hour  with the stupid agent to find out why? He went quiet! Gave me a stupid excuse  that no sense  whatsoever.  He was supposed  to take out money November  9. The morons took out money  today, October 27!! Useless!!"
1748,Trust Pilot ,NA,"They just totally suck! I have a car loan with them have been trying to activate my online account for almost a year spend numerous amounts of time on the phone then today get told to go to a branch its for own security I can owe you $56,000 for my car but cant access my account SMH"
1749,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotiabank is giving me trauma. I traveled out of Canada and access to my Banking app was blocked.  I was made to make expensive international calls totalling over 2hours and no resolution was provided to my plight.I am unable to access funds or service my bill payments thereby incurring late payment penalties and reduced credit score ratings. This is very painful after giving all useful information, despite all explanation that I'm out of the country,  these nincompoops tell me I have to make an in-person branch appearance as if they are funding my flight ticket.  I am cut out in a limbo.First thing to do on my return is to discontinue patronage with such a cruel bank.I spoke with 6 staffers and none of these dust heads could provide resolution. Worst of them all were Julie and Emily of the Fraud protection unit. The 4 others ones in their contact center with number +12049855125 don't even know their left from right and kept tossing me round in circles."
1750,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I called Scotiabank to put a stop payment on 3 companies. It was one call ant took less than 2 minutes to put them on. For that 2 minutes, they charged me $20 for each stop payment. This is ridiculous. It should be one price if it is done in the same call. It seems like banks are just like our government, all about the almighty dollar. Even their seniors rates suck. I will definitely be looking around for another institution to deal with. I DO NOT recommend Scotiabank."
1751,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I just moved from US to CA. This is by far the worst banking I have had. There have been multiple issues form the get go like when I opened my accounts my email, address, and phone number were entered wrong making it super difficult to get anything changed. Once that was finally updated it's been one issue after another. Blocking multiple e transfers when I'm trying to receive or send money. The app is horrible so of course you have to call in and get transferred 8 times just to get a block off your account from fraud protection. Should have gone with TD."
1752,Trust Pilot ,NA,I am very pleased with Scotia bank customer service! There was immediate respond and the problem was solved in minutes
1753,Trust Pilot ,NA,Call centres don’t want to do their work so they drop the calls so you can’t dispute a situation.  Answering the phone calls drop before going through.  Calls drop while talking to them.  Do your jobs stop dropping calls because people’s money is on the line.  Try to dispute my credit card that’s been in a consumer proposal so they can not come after me for payments.  They list missed payments on my credit hurting my credit when I’ve been working hard to build back up.  My score has dropped because of their claim of missed payments on my credit score.  One pissed off customer here
1754,Trust Pilot ,NA,Would give 0 star if I could. Financial advisor didn’t do her job. So I was stuck wondering why my appointment with a notary was canceled . Took several emails and phone calls to get an answer after two weeks! One of the advisors told me with a fed-up tone that he was very busy.. and I should write him an email. I wrote him two emails before getting him on the phone. Then the branch director took matters in her own hands but…more delays! Mortgage Documents supposed to be issued and sent to me within a day showed up 3 days later after several mails and voice messages. And when I thought it would be a bit smoother now .. spoiler no! More delays and no explanation. What should have been taken a week isn’t done after a month. Worst experience ever. Customer service is a big 0!! Don’t go there. Avoid at all costs.
1755,Trust Pilot ,NA,"It's ridiculous that branches won't be open for and entire weekend, not even the machines are open at Radisson Heights. People do work...."
1756,Trust Pilot ,NA,"These crooks literally keep draining my account, then basically tell me ""too bad"" afterward. I've complained about that numerous times, but nothing ever changes.They also locked me out of my online banking for almost a week, (wouldn't provide me with a reason/explanation for that) and gave me the runaround when I called and tried to get it all figured out. Don't EVER bank with these morons unless you like feeling robbed every month. 😡"
1757,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I will never recommend Scotiabank. I have used Scotiabank for all my banking needs for 17+ years and but I will be switching to another bank. I was encouraged by Scotiabank employees, who came out my university, to sign up for a Professional Student Line of Credit. My school program is intense and takes 8+ years so some financial assistance was required. After graduating, I was paying off my line of credit, however my husband and I unexpectedly become pregnant. I am currently on maternity leave and Scotiabank no longer offers their pause on line of credits which allows only the interest to be paid during maternity leaves. As a result, I have had to empty my entire life savings, sell everything I own, and borrow money from family and friends in order to try to cover my minimum payments of $2300.00 a month!!! Keep in mind that this payment doesn’t include my cost of living, which is additionally astronomically high given the soaring food prices, rent, gas prices, etc. I have had meetings with Scotiabank as well as countless phone calls and they tell me there is nothing they can do to help. Once I return to work, I understand being expected to pay, which is no problem at all. I believe it is negligent for Scotiabank to be encouraging young female professional students to get lines of credits knowing that there isn’t any way these women will be able afford payments if they start a family. The least the bank can do is pause payments and allow for the interest to be paid during a maternity absence. Scotiabank has lost a life long client. I will be warning other university students (of my predominantly female profession) about this predicament so they do not fall into the same financial trap I am currently dealing with."

1759,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I have been a customer for 25 years.  I have a number of accounts with them, well into six figures.  I have called and sent emails requesting details on a retirement account.  They have not responded, nor provided an explanation.  I made a complaint through their ""system.""  They retaliated by closing all of my accounts. There is evidence they did this because of my age and a disability.  Avoid this bank. Question everything.  You can do better when banking in Canada."
1760,Trust Pilot ,NA,Scotia bank needs to realise that people do not have time to spend all day merely trying to access a working ATM. Harbour mall ATM works 20% of the time. The ATMs in town work roughly 50% of the time. The bank resembles a concert venue with the number of people forced to sit around waitingfor service and the ATMs are one set of confusion.Scotia Bank in Guyana is barely functioning and an embarrassment to the banking sector.
1761,Trust Pilot ,NA,After waiting for an hour. Scotiabank flagged my account fraud. Without calling first they locked my account because I had more money  than usual in account. Then I called and waited an hour and a half. When the guy answered he asked for my card number in a very rude manner.so I said can you hold on for a sec while I get my card and he said well you should have had it ready and I said sorry I don't have  it ready. And he hung up on me.wow thanks guy I will be moving my services else where. Obviously scotiabank does not care about customers and won't say anything about my post or will I make a difference but I am not a scotiabank customer anymore
1762,Trust Pilot ,NA,"You literally are forcing me to activate 2 step verification and refusing to allow me to access my account unless i do. My phone broke and i literally cant access my account. If thats not illegal, it definitely should be. So yeah i've had enough of this. You'll be kissing my 12 years of ""loyalty"" right out the door, in due time. Thanks so much."
1763,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Increases fees I. Hard times, poor customer service, ATMs that are out of service/won’t accept cash. Tried 3 different banks but couldn’t find one that worked."
1764,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Bank of America customers are advised to use Scotia Bank while travelling to avoid ATM fees. This is true, except that Scotia Bank applies the absolute worst exchange rate possible - as much as 15-18% worse than the inter-bank rate. It is a total scam.I am calling Bank of America today to ask them to not recommend Scotia Bank.STAY AWAY FROM SCOTIA BANK"
1765,Trust Pilot ,NA,"We have book an appointment today online. When we went there, they said the agent is on vacation whom you have set an appointment and we can't assign you another agent. My question is why the online system is booking an appointment with someone who is on vacation. Very Unprofessional. They should know their mistake and at least give an other appointment. The agent didn't even bother to apologize. I have a business account with them. Always I am getting this type of treatment from the Scotiabank agent. Now, I am going to move my account to another bank. Today, I was really done with them. I went to Saint Catherine Montreal branch."
1766,Trust Pilot ,NA,"The worse bank to deal with, incompetent to no degree. I am taking all my accounts and investments out of this institution. If anyone is thinking of doing business with Scotiabank think again. Run don't walk."
1767,Trust Pilot ,NA,Scotiabank has to be the crapiest bank in the world bad service extremly bad customer service.  They actually like to defecate on you of and hang up.  Impossible to understand them then they blaim you for not understanding.  Incredible worst service ever and they just could not care 3 years mortgages is over and will never again do business with that retar d ed bank.
1768,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Worst bank I've been (I was client with 4 other banks in my lifetime). Been with them for 1 year. They don't call when they should for you to get your cards. They then send them back. Your online is then blocked. My credit card was fully paid every month. My checking account had over $5 000,00. After complaining (without any rudeness or threats) they decided to demarket me (close all my accounts, credits and never go back to them). When asked for a reason they answered that when opening my account I agreed they can close it when they want for whatever reason they want (fine prints). My daughter also applied for a credit card and was accepted. The branch (not same as mine) also never called her and sent the card back. When she enquired about it they yelled at her and told her she had to wait 3 months to re-apply. Search and you'll find similar cards from other banks.This bank is not worth it."
1769,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I struggle with the accents. I've never had an easy customer service experience, the English is really brutal. I'm constantly asking for the agents to repeat themselves. My name is not Mr. Troy, and forget repeating back long strings of numbers and letters."
1770,Trust Pilot ,NA,"For the past Month, I've been trying to get myself a Credit Card trough Scotiabank, simply to get my credit score up. Mind you I am 19 years old.  And throughout the past month I've had to call them at least 9 times if not more, to give them ""more information"". To the point were they knew what I ate for Breakfast. I'd say 90% of the people I talked to on the phone were completely useless and didn't know what they were even talking about. But even after those millions of calls, letters, documents sent, employment letters, and whatnot, I was DENIED. what a compete and Uther waste of my time, and a tremendous showcase of incompetence for the costumer service crew over there. Absolutely Appalling.Shoutout to ""Xavier"", the only person that I had to pleasure talking to that actually knew what he was talking about."
1771,Trust Pilot ,NA,Very poor customer service over the phone. Unable to fix access to mobile app and help reset password.Left problem for a few days and called again and customer service asking questions about my accounts that I would only know if I had access to my account. How stupid can you be!!! Yet all the most important personal banking info was given. So mad. Now I am going to escalate to upper management. What a waste of my time.
1772,Trust Pilot ,NA,Terrible absolutely terrible customer service. It’s actually laughable bad.
1773,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Bloody aweful, advice so bad even another scotiabank advisor said it was wrong and I would be paying excess tax. My instruction to my advisor, to replace himself was simply ignored. When i transfered money in, i had 10 missed calls in a morning. My complaint to the branch manager was ignored, not escalated and now it's 28 days old with only an acknowledgement to show. I'm taking my money and leaving."
1774,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I got several calls on my phone from Scotia.  Didn't leave a message, so I don't know what's wrong.  I call them back.  They have to autenticate me.  So I start answering questions: I give my creditd card number, my full name, my date of birth, 4 last digit of my phone number, give a recent transaction (amount and date) and they ask what is my overdraft, my latest payment.  Could not answer those last 2 questions so they could not autenticate me.  Bye bye.  You'd think after answering SIX questions, they would finally tell me why THEY CALLED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE."
1775,Trust Pilot ,NA,Less than 1 star if I could.  Charged my son - who is a student - almost $40 in fees in one month.  Service charge - $20.00; service charge monthly fees $16.95; service charge record keeping fees $2.25.  He went to enquire and close his account and said they would get back to him and reimburse the fees. He is a busy student with two jobs and money is tight.  They never got back to him and he ended up with the same charges again!  Highway robbery of a young struggling student!!
1776,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotiabank is without a doubt the worst and most expensive bank I have ever been with.  I have tried to access my account on several occasions through their ""Customer Service"" department with no luck.  I lost my phone and wasn't able to access my online banking.  Even though I was able to answer personal questions... that only I could answer, they asked me vague things regarding my transaction history (I.e How much I spent a two different stores with the same name but different shop I.D numbers).   After awhile I became frustrated and asked to speak to a supervisor.  She was rude and told me if I don't like their policies ""I should cancel my account"".  I am shocked by how they acted. Will be calling them again... I want employee I.D's and a recording.   There is a reason for the 1.2 star rating.  I was told to stay away (and should have listened).  Scotiabank is the WORST.**IMPORTANT** They should be ashamed and embarrassed.  I would never treat one of my paying customer's with such disrespect and rudeness.  It is almost laughable."
1777,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Bank with useless customer service representatives whether in Mexico, Dominican Republic, or Canada.  Even at the branch level, the staff are empowered to do absolutely nothing...even for the Senior Customer Experience Associate.  High rates, terrible service, confusing site navigation.  Better options exist."
1778,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Talked to Lucy at Customer service regarding my new visa card that had not arrived; Lucy was outstanding knowledgeable searching for answers, and truly polite and friendly. Her service was much appreciated. Thank you, Lucy"
1779,Trust Pilot ,NA,The worst software and application on the market. Each time !!  I try to go online to see my accounts it asks me to reset my current password . Online does not work. Each time you need to call customer rep - wait on the phone -answer their security questions -manually !!! = 19 century !!to reset password with their support only. Unbelievable!! Three times for ONE  day it asked me to reset password. The same happened withxfriedn of mine !! Shame
1780,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Wanted to sign up for an account basically if I Let them hold my money hostage then it's okay according to them, you know it's not they're harder money. It's my harder money that I would not recommend this bank"
1781,Trust Pilot ,NA,"If scotiabank identifies fraudulent activity on bank account and I confirm activity is fraudulent, should the account not be secured until I get to the bank to update my banking information? They allowed fraudulent activity to continue causing thousands to be stolen."
1782,Trust Pilot ,NA,"got me to sign mortgage paper without content, then fill out by the advisor after--- no email or a copy sent to me after until I found out  my updated information on line -- was totally screwed and showed much higher rateThey tried to trap you and would not admit itI learned it at a hard way"
1783,Trust Pilot ,NA,"The fraud department blocked every single etransfer made to my Coinbase account, which I set up, because they said people were not receiving payments from it. The only people with activity on that account is me, and I haven't had any issues. This despite me calling and explaining the situation, every time. Suffice to say, this is the fourth time in as many transactions, so I will unfortunately have to waste more time finding a new bank to conduct business through. Get your facts straight and improve staff training."
1784,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I left Canada without closing my account in SCOTIA BANK and without taking or sending my money to France. This is SCOTIA'S POLICY:- they do not transfer my money in France, I request it by email — but they said me by phone+mail this is possible; now they say I have to send a fax- they do not send me any information about the transfer rate- they blocked all possibilities for any online transfer in my account (transfer between my accounts, Interac, and Western Union).- they do not accept refund of money (checks) from my Canadian Social Security (I have to deposit personally in the bank in Montreal)- they do not permit me to make any changing in my account- they did not pay me the amount I earned by using a ""Savings"" account for 1 year (they say because my Social Security ended)•• DO NOT EVER OPEN AN ACCOUNT IN SCOTIA BANK. IT IS THE MOST AGRESSIVE POLICY I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED WITH A BANK in 4 different countries (France, Greece, USA, Canada).•• DO NOT LEAVE YOUR MONEY IN CANADA!"
1785,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotiabank has not been able to complete one task for me without massive hassle and many errors on their part for YEARS. They have an embarrassing level of service. Now, they can't find any interac transactions of mine after 2018. I would trust a grade three class with my money before I would Scotiabank."
1786,Trust Pilot ,NA,I can’t believe how disappointing and poor customer service this bank this guy name  Miguel  he is horrible person  he ask the customer stupid questions no body can’t understand and waist my time omg he is disaster and I hope they hire professional customer service
1787,Trust Pilot ,NA,"If you're a small business and value your future, stay FAR, FAR away from Scotia. I should qualify that a lot of the big banks are nickel and diming their customers just as badly, but I can definitely speak about Scotia and our experience.I don't know when it started, but I recently discovered a ""Service Charge"" for a few hundred dollars came out of our business account at a CRITICAL time for our business.I started digging into it, and discovered that at some point, we were now being charged $1.25 for EVERY SINGLE TRANSACTION - that means every debit, credit, deposit, you name it. Every automated action was now costing us $1.25 EACH.I went through our account history and discovered that we've been paying THOUSANDS in fees.Their alternative? $120 a month for the privilege of letting Scotiabank take your money.Remember when banks were once USEFUL?"
1788,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Our trust account was closed without notification. Funds are unable to be deposited now due to this. Rent cannot be paid/food cannot be bought, as this is a monthly payment. I've either been on hold or transferred all day long after waiting on hold for 45 minutes! Branch manager never called as promised. WORST BANKING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!"
1789,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Company has the worst credit card, The App is constantly locking you out, can't ever get in to your account to find out why you're locked out. Meanwhile the card keeps charging you money, can't ever get support that can do anything. Always ask you to go into a branch. Then the people at the branch have no idea what's going on and refer you back to the phone line. The whole bank is a scam and so are their credit cards. DON'T ever give them your money or sign up for their cards."
1790,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Terrible. Brown guy on the phone and he responds like a turtle, every 30 seconds he answers, and a lot of time he's just silent and no response. Tried to help initially for 1 minute, and the rest of the 20 minute call he just... stayed silent. LOL."
1791,Trust Pilot ,NA,Horrible online banking .locks you out steady.if u don't have your own internet and if using public computers to check your online banking  it won't work.lm closing my account.should be able to check your banking on any computer u want.
1792,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Very poor customer service. I was actually hung up on when the employee couldn’t be bothered, his name was Dan and said he was a supervisor. They can’t even solve minor issues. Pretty low end back I’d say! Crappy experience all around. 1 hour wasted and problem not resolved."
1793,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Loyalty means nothing with this bank. Been with this bank for over 20years, the constant changing of the account terms. You lose what you had and been modified so anything you use to utilize you have pay for everything."
1794,Trust Pilot ,NA,"DO NOT BANK WITH SCOTIA !!Their employees know zero about banking, they will give you the run around, and if you phone they'll put you on hold endlessly.Then they will say they will set up what you need in the future, but when you check in later, NOTHING WILL HAVE BEEN DONE!! And the whole incompetent run around will start again.I kid you not, they will put you on hold for hours, trying to figure out how to solve your BASIC(!!) REQUEST.Then if and when you ask for a manager or supervisor, to complain, the run around will just continue, putting you on hold endlessly.I have tried going to 3 different branches and talked on the phone, with said above process, 3 times.Now, is it super complicated what I ask?,  you wonder. NO!Just a stop payment.It would have been, and will be, faster to go to a different bank and open an account there !!!!DO NOT BANK WITH SCOTIA, THEY ARE A JOKE !!Only time you'll be helped professionally is when you want to bring them (new) business.-10 out of 0 stars"
1795,Trust Pilot ,NA,Do you still wait in line to deposit a cheque ? That's so last year. With Scotiabank you can deposit your check into your account quick and easy. Don't know how? Ask one of their amazing customer service representatives. Modern day banking technology at your fingertips. They offer great services and understand your needs.
1796,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Got a new phone and had to call to activate my online account since they do a stupid authentication for ""our protection"".  The east indian lady was so rude to me, I answered all the questions until she asked the last time I used my card which I couldn't quite remember but I was close and instead of asking me more questions she said my account is locked now and hung up.  Called back and there's nothing they can do now, I have to drive 2 hours to the closest bank.  Hate scotia and their customer service sucks, no one cares there.  Closing all my accounts."
1797,Trust Pilot ,NA,"they removed money from my account without permission and applied it to my credit card without permission, and customer service is unacceptable"
1798,Trust Pilot ,NA,Rude and Unprofessional employees... Each employee  thinks- She/He owns the business.
1799,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I have always been impressed with the overall service level and product offerings from this bank.  I have dealt with many such institutions and Scotiabank (especially Humbertown branch service) has always left me happy.  They may not be everything to everyone (I don't believe any banks are...most have their strengths and weaknesses), and Scotiabank has the best mortgage products/offerings as well as short term investment offerings and for that I'm grateful...plus they always call you back."
1800,Trust Pilot ,NA,Very bad experience and the lady was talking on the call she has a really bad attitude as well as unprofessional and I had to end up with hung up the call. It didn’t resolve my problem. I’m using Scotiabank card since 2018 but today I’m thinking I had to switch to the another bank.
1801,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Their ATMs never work for deposits, lock the branch doors without ATM access each night. Don't help with anything but are happy to take all your money"
1802,Trust Pilot ,NA,Garbage bank. My card got stolen tried to call and cancel it they asked the stupidest security questions (that were not even tied to my account.) random stuff I wouldn’t know like the last payment on a card THAT I DONT HAVE! so im going to have to go into a branch tomorrow. Hope im lucky they dont have one of their random holidays off 👍🏻
1803,Trust Pilot ,NA,Document every call with time and date ! These people are beyond the most untrained and stressful humans on this planet ! They lie cheat and steal ! Even with lawyers involved and their escalation department involved they can’t get their heads on straight !
1804,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I've spent the past 2 years attempting to manage my account with Scotiabank Turks & Caicos. They have requested repeatedly forms of documentation like drivers license, passport, personal and business documents etc. etc. Yet they continue to make ridiculous excuses to keep me away from my $5525. I think they are simply trying to make me give up so they can steal my funds. Scotiabank, I have retained all the email communications illustrating how crooked you are. Care to challenge me to release these publicly and humiliate your company further?"
1805,Trust Pilot ,NA,Never bank with Scotiabank. Harmful threatening emails. They act more mafia than a bank
1806,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Worst service ever. They don't respond to your mails and never make the work done. My draft was never made , cheque wasnt issued even after saying its ready . I always return back without getting anything. Its been 5 months since I haven’t given my money."
1807,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I have been with Scotia since 1975.  I have been happy until recently.  The investment specialist makes so many mistakes, such as missing the appointment, making errors in the setup of the investment ect.  This person is suppose to be a professional.  The itrade new app with this 2 step verification is a joke.  Scotiabank should not dictate if I use a password, pin, fingerprints ect to use the mobile app.   I get the phone apps fixed and the pc login doesn't work.  I get the pc login corrected, once again the phone apps don't work.  I call customer service the person doesn't speak English and asks verification questions on accounts that have not been used for 25 years.  I don't want to move my assets but Scotia is forcing me to look for another bank.I would never recommend Scotiabank"
1808,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotia bank runs its offers like a scam.I enrolled for their Chequing account and TFSA account offers late 2022 (somewhere in the last quarter).They will take your money in very easily but when you try to avail their offers, they will find creative ways to deter you from the offer so that they dont have to pay you what the offer claims.  I had to manually check off ""valid"" transactions with a CC rep on the phone to qualify for the cheqing account offer. Finally after 2 months of back and forth, got my $350. Next the TFSA offer which ended on 31st May 2023. They will not tell you that if you move money out of your TFSA to a different bank, they will invariably close your account so that they don't have to pay you.What a scammy service from a Canadian bank. The CC is as bad as the other reviews mentioned it."
1809,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Their exchange rates are incredibly low. I could have saved 157 CAD. In addition they charge a 15 dollar fee. They basically steal on foreign exchange, from hard working people. Banks are already rich, like come on. Traditional banks are not considering their customers at all. Decided to no transfer money anymore to Scotia, and use remitly instead. Their exchange rate is way more close to the global set exchange rate."
1810,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Worst customers service experience , i called and they always says i haven’t answer the authentication. for the First time happens as I’ve been with scotiabank for 10 yrs. The agents over the phone  doesn’t speak english properly and clearly when they asked verifications, imagine if you are on another country or at the emergency and you needed a help with your bank. And they will tell you to go to your nearest branch as they cannot help at all.I’ll be switching with another bank as the customers services experiences with scotiabank has been horrible lately . They refused to help they will say go to the bank as you didn’t pass the authentication. Looks like their system is broken or not updated as well.  What’s going on customers service!!!"
1811,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Their machines are always broken and their banks look old and sad. I can’t make payments to my VISA at the ATM machine without some sort of issue (money being return, card not accepted, etc) It’s constant frustration & problems. Do yourself a favour and bank with TD instead"
1812,Trust Pilot ,NA,I am giving one star because I cannot give no star. I wanted to close my chequing account and receive the amount in my account in cash. I was told that I need to order the money one week in advance if I want cash! A big bank such as Scotiabank does not have $5000 cash and I need to wait one week?! The manageress was also very condescending.
1813,Trust Pilot ,NA,Best bank at stealing people's money!Best bank at wasting people's time!Worst Customer service ever!BBW!
1814,Trust Pilot ,NA,"scotia on line  is complete garbage, on a regular bases and I mean regularly my accounts are not available .Today not one was available, cant pay bills cant send money cant see if you got paid cant see how much money you got . stay away go to another bank, never had this problem never with RBC."
1815,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Ever been to Trafalgar and Dundas branch in Oakville? Bring lunch and plenty of fluids for the long wait times there. They do serve up though a hefty portion of attitude complimentary.Todays experience was no different to the few other times I have had to use them, so at least they have consistency. Credit where credit is due (pardon the pun) though likely will have a 5 day hold placed on that too!"
1816,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I would give zero stars if I could…. Switched from ATB and it was the worst decision we ever made, the level of incompetence at this bank is unbelievable. They cost be over 600$ in late fees because they couldn’t figure out the preauthorized debit and then wouldn’t refund any of the funds although…. How could you possibly get late fees when you have automatic withdraws set up. Whenever we call we get different answers from their help centre… Worst bank ever, we dislike them so much and are devastated we switched, all for a better “rate” thanks… literally cost me hundreds of dollars just having them manage our mortgages."
1817,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Lately the customer service has been abysmal. The reps don't seem to know anything (although if they'd listen to the customer that might help marginally).  The worse part is thier lofty attitudes.  Even worse when they don't speak English well.  I've been a customer since 1987 and until this year never had an issue.   The 2 step verification seems to mess everything up, there is no follow up or survey after dealing with the reps, and the reps just don't care.  If I could move my mortgage easily, I'd definitely be switching to another bank because I've had it with them."
1818,Trust Pilot ,NA,Absolutely disgusting... not a atom of common sense in any of the  representatives.. GET ME SOMEONE OVER FIFTY WITH COMMON SENSE.... who can speak clear English.. Even the supervisor didn't know what to do and it was an error made by  the bank ..... GOD HELP US ALL .
1819,Trust Pilot ,NA,The worst bank ever. They close your account without notice and steal all your money. Honestly I feel like there is some fraud going on in that bank. Don't bank here EVER.
1820,Trust Pilot ,NA,"The rudest customer service I've ever encountered. On every occasion I've called. From being made to feel stupid (for the automated phone system not accepting my card number as valid) from being told I needed to calm down, and be more professional I was being an 'emotional woman' when my credit card was compromised (maybe I WAS emotional, my credit card had just been compromised, but I was hardly unprofessional, besides, it wasn't MY job to be professional) Today I begin the process of moving my mortgage and savings from this horrible, useless bank."
1821,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotiabank's Customer Services are the WORST compared with other banks (I have banked with most major banks in Canada, except Scotia).  I just opened my Ultimate chequing account (the most expensive account with $30.95 monthly fee) with Scotia 2 weeks ago but unfortunately it's a terrible experience.  I called in for a single issue with my debit card, that I tried to make an online transaction, but its said to call the bank for further verification due to security reason (this same issue happened in the past when used the other cards, but I was able to resolve it right away when I called in with TD, BMO, CIBC or Royal Bank).  Now with Scotiabank, I spoke with 4 different reps: Gabriel, someone I forgot to ask for the name, Rahul and Emmanuel (they kept transferring me to different people from different departments: online banking, then security department and the complaint department), and I had to answer the total of 14 security questions from these 4 different reps, and they still could not resolve the issues,  I was with 4 different reps for 90 minutes.  These reps seem very inexperience and I had a very hard time to  understand them.  I requested to submit a complaint about my experience, Mr. Emmanuel from the ""Complaint Department"" intentionally discouraged me from submitting it by delaying it, up to the point I had to end the call.  It's completely a very FIRST - TERRIBLE experience over the phone with Scotiabank Customer Service and still my simple issue is not resolved and now I understand why no-one in my circle uses Scotia."
1822,Trust Pilot ,NA,Poor French services in French … Canadian bank by the way
1823,Trust Pilot ,NA,The 2 step verification is annoying. Every time I have to log in to my account it's asking me to deactivate and activate and deactivate and activate over and over again. I can't memorize my debit card number and so annoying I have to input it everytime I have to log in.
1824,Trust Pilot ,NA,So I got a savings account with scotiabank on a whim to try and save some money before hitting financial issues. I was able to walk in and do it same day.I proceeded to need the money in the account. I was soon put into overdraft because apparently it's 5 dollars a transaction which I wasn't told.Then after that's resolved. I tried to walk in and open a chequing account. Since I did a savings it should of worked. Nope. I'd have to have a damn meeting with a financial advisor. It was an emergency thing because my purely online banks card went missing. So got screwed. So I can open a savings without talking to anyone but not a chequing account? I can even do it online bit God forbid.Now I tried to cancel. They locked me out of my account by putting 2 factor on it without my consent. And when I tried to close the account they told me I'd have to transfer out the 0.25$ I have in it to close it. Refused to close it. And now I have to go in person to close it.**** them so hard.
1825,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I opened the accounts in January. Since I did not receive the 4.6% interest, I called the customer service hotline at the beginning of February. The agent explained I did not get the interest because I signed up for my account at the end of January, and the system will give it back to me in February. On March 08, 2023, I called an agent since I still did not get my interest correctly. The agent, Megan Dill, promised his manager would call me back and solve the issue, but I never got any response from them until now. I complained to the bank, and they explained they told me I can not get my interest in MARCH, so they won't credit me back the interest. I am very disappointed about the service and just feel they are telling lies to a customer. The staff is very unprofessional and they did not take the responsibility to credit me back the interest."
1826,Trust Pilot ,NA,Went into my branch today to pull out some money and found they had closed my account after being with Scotia for over 14 yrs. I would recommend using any other bank than these guys. They say they are there for customer service well where is it when people are struggling to make ends meet? Never again will l bank with them
1827,Trust Pilot ,NA,Scotia need to better there ABMs everyday is the same thing this is ridiculous Everytime you go to the atms in Ocho Rios they are down why…early morning you go to pull money the machines are down you guys need to do better.
1828,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I just paid my credit cards off in full, I struggled to meet some payments as a small business owner in hospitality, it’s been incredibly difficult to get by. I called Scotia Mastercard to request a new card and tell them I paid the full balance. I was denied and my card was cancelled, the rep then told me that Scotia bank is not in the business of helping people. So true. I’m closing all my accounts."
1829,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotia bank branch on Yonge and Lawrence, still the best costumer service for me. I went there today after four years of going to other branches near me, they’re nothing compare to this branch. I was assisted by Erminia today and she did what other branch couldn’t do for the last four years,she was courteous and overall helpful. I highly recommend this branch and I think I am going to ask my fiancé to transfer his account to this branch. Best costumer service and best branch… the worse is Bayview Village and Yonge Blvd: branches."
1830,Trust Pilot ,NA,I have been a customer  for over 30 years their service used to be amazing I don't know what happened I would also know that after dealing with the bank for 30 years how they can refuse me for a MasterCard and other Banks as well as stores have approved me now you think my own bank would approve me right I think I'm going to be closing my Scotia account very soon and going with another branch I think this scholarship bank is going downhill a lot of people do not like that bank anymore it's also empty every time I go into it I wonder why someone actually got a new bank card in my name without my knowledge good thing I just happened to check to see if my otsp check was being deposited and they told me that that bank card number did not exist I almost fell off my chair they said no you had received your new card 15 days ago I told him I never applied for a new card I never went into your bank and told anybody I had lost my card nothing I said do you not have to go into the branch to get a new card or anybody can have your name your address call and have a new bank card sent to them I don't believe I got an answer as of yet I said if a person had to walk into the bank then obviously you have somebody working from the inside panning their friends out bank cards and other people's names and that's how fraud is being committed and identity thefts think about it that's not a branch I want to continue with
1831,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Can't deposit cash from selling a car. Deposit is greyed out on all banking machines. Got home to register complaint with bank in Calgary and kept getting sent to Scotia banks in Trinidad and Tobago. This bank is a frigging joke. I don't bank here, my son does and he is finally washing his hands of them. Crappy bank, crappy service."
1832,Trust Pilot ,NA,"My father is dying in palliative care in another province and Scotiabank refused to defer our $618 payment to help with travel costs. They act as though a car payment is life or death, I can assure them it is NOT. They have zero compassion and we won't be asking them for a loan on the future."
1833,Trust Pilot ,NA,Had a few issues with this alleged bank. 1. A transaction of $180 missing from account 2. When I told them that I did not make that transaction. They simply said a deal laid is a deal played amd there was nothing they could do. 3. Staff spoke down to me like I was a child.
1834,Trust Pilot ,NA,"If you have any other option, then never ever use Scotiabank. I opened Scotiabank account, there was for preferred package an offer for $350. After 6months, I was told I am not eligible for this offer, and I asked transfer my call to the manager who is Luis Ardila Morin, he said he believe I am eligible and he will follow up. He confirmed my phone number and said he will call me next week. He also gave me his email address to follow up. I sent him a couple email one week later after the conversation, no reply and no phone call. It is disgusting. Never trust Scotiabank."
1835,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I have never been a Scotia's customer.  Yet ScotiaBank illegally issued a credit card in my name with wrong DOB, wrong postal address, and no SIN. Then posted the account to Equifax and Trans Union.   Getting it cancelled was hell on Earth! No less 11 letters and countless phone calls. I was ignored, treated rudely, and accused of lying.  Is this gross incompetence? Or internal fraud to boost card issuance quotas? Of couse they will not answer that. No explanations of why they did this and refused to promptly rectify the situation when notified."
1836,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I had been banking with Scotiabank for over ten years and just recently I switched to a new bank. More times than not, their app doesn't work. They have something called ""courtesy overdraft"" which is just robbery because they say they'll let a transaction go through to not charge you overdraft but then charge a $15 overdrawn handling fee on top of the monthly fee. I been noticing these charges for months now until I recently called in and their adviser was like it can't be removed over the phone, lmao. They're telling me I'm in the negative balance but that's not what I'm seeing through the mobile app. It makes no sense, how can I transfer and spend money that's not in the account in the first place. Their telephone service is never of any help. I'm pretty much fed up with Scotiabank's shenanigans."
1837,Trust Pilot ,NA,I am DEAF Which mean I can not hear. The customer service doesn't care and wouldn't help DEAF clients. So disrespect to DEAF community. I tried explain I am DEAF and they hung up. Even worse the account who active hard to reach. Bad mangers of staff work there.
1838,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I sent an international Money transfer to USA , the person at other end did not know that their bank could not receive it. So we recent thru another means. I called Scotia to Cancel the Transfer and told them the story. I sent $5000 US  ($6868 CDN)  Its been 3 months they still have not refunded money int my account , the person I sent to US checked his bank they know nothing. I get the run around everytime I call. last they said would call me back Wednesday its Saturday still nothing. They are awful quick taking there fees from accounts, charge for everything, and ask how they are doing service wise. Its Bullcrap Im a senior being out that money is tough they just dont seem to care."
1839,Trust Pilot ,NA,Thank you scotia bank. I was looking for a bank where I can use my card to buy crypto so I could invest some money with planoff_investment as emergency funds. The card worked well and Ihave been able to make enough profits on the investment platform.All thanks Scotia
1840,Trust Pilot ,NA,They think they can go digital without asking customers  I'll be closing that account  credit union here I cone
1841,Trust Pilot ,NA,"screwed my sons account so bad everything at collections and other things ,,then led to believe everything would be taken care of today  nobody even knew of such an appointment, now i dont no what to do but i will complain"
1842,Trust Pilot ,NA,"This is not the first time I have had this issue.  I have used this bank for over 20 years. Two months ago I had a major surgery,  I'm looking at 6 months to a year off work,  and I only today recieved my government disability cheque.  The bank refused to cash it,  saying they will hold everything but $100 for 5 business days.  They told me they couldn't trust it would go through so they needed to hold it.  It's a government cheque.  It's not a personal cheque.  I told them I am 2 month behind on rent,  and all my bills,  and $100 would not cover it.  I've been going up the food bank,  I need the money now,  5 business days won't work.  They still refused.  I have a savings only account with another bank, and I took it there,  and they cashed it for me.  I will be switching banks as soon as I can.  I understand 5 days is not long,  but it is when you have no money and bills are piling up."
1843,Trust Pilot ,NA,"never mind that their accounts are not the easiest to figure out, I was hacked Dec 21/22 it is now march 27.I have spent so much time on the phone dealing with fraud staff who didnt want to even look up info, hung up on me, no I was not rude.dealing with customer service, told they would get in touch with me, gave me most of my money back but not all of it, the last call i was told they had dropped the ball and they would have it in there and call me on the 22. now they say oh its been 90 days , there is nothing we are going to do ,"
1844,Trust Pilot ,NA,you will be charged $48 dollar if your account is insufficent. and this penalty does not have cap. This is a bank that trying to rob your money by hiding toxic terms in the contract.Avoid this bank. Or completely read their terms and conditions.
1845,Trust Pilot ,NA,"The most terrible service and ridiculous product from mid-ages. I am the customer of Scotiabank in Barbados. While was new to the island, didn't know of how terrible they are. Onboarding process is a joke. They continuously lie on timelines, request additional documentations every other day. There's no requirements provided upfront, so you send one piece of documents, wait for a week, then they requests for something else. My applications for credit card lasts for 2 months now and I sent like 20+ emails to them. Their app is ridiculously basic. You can only transfer money intra-country, pay a bill and top up mobile. For literally everything you have to go to branch and wait in a line for hours to be served.When I opened an account I wasn't introduced into any limits of my debit card. Encountered that there's a 1000USD limit per day only when I was travelling abroad and couldn't pay for medical services. Tried reaching my bank to seek limit increase, they are non responsive and even if they respond, just keep saying 'this is the limit'. No solution suggested."
1846,Trust Pilot ,NA,Totally non responsive to non functional online banking app. Pull your money folks before its too late.
1847,Trust Pilot ,NA,I cant get into my on line banking.  A bully ad about stocks. Hit the continue banking and still stuck with scotia Intercepting advertisement.  Incredible!  I'll go back to telephone banking!
1848,Trust Pilot ,NA,"If you’re looking for someone who is sincere genuine and goes over and beyond for you, Meagan is just that girl! Appreciate the amazing experience you offered this morning. One of a kind!"
1849,Trust Pilot ,NA,We signed the agreement new advance date to be February 27th and the first payment on march 1st. They ignored all my emails till March 2nd. and ten instead to pay to a mortgage they sent money to my checking account so I have to pay interest on the money that wasn't withdrawn. Very poor performance.
1850,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Don’t use Scotiabank the staff are not trained well and rude. Since I opened an account with Scotiabank everything became a disaster for me. They did not give me a debit card upon opening which is supposedly the first thing they will do, my credit card arrived first and when I asked them about my debit card, they told me that I should have got it the same day I opened an account so they asked me to come back and pick up the card. 2nd incident was when I lost my credit card and someone used my card and purchased a lot which cost around $1800. When I found out I called Scotiabank right away and waited for more than 2hrs to get hold of an agent, spoke to the agent for less than 5mins. He told me they will cancel my card and will do an investigation but the next day the person who got my card used my card to buy stuff again so now I have a debt of $2838.41. I called Scotiabank again and wasted hours. They just told me the same thing. I asked what happened why my card wasn’t block or locked yet. They just told me they will look into it, and will send me a new card after 7-10business days. They didn’t  even bother to give me an explanation as to why my card wasn’t locked when I already reported it and someone is using it!  The card never arrived so I called the bank to update only to find out that it was never process! Now someone called me from billing asking me to pay. Never heard an update regarding my case and when I called Scotia for an update they kept on passing me from one agent to another! Still nothing is happening they only gave me a number that is useless!"
1851,Trust Pilot ,NA,"They used to be good. I started banking with these guys about 2 decades ago, even transferred all my money and business to these guys.The problem is now I need to intermittently take money out of the RESP to pay my kid's tuition etc., and it's like pulling teeth. Every customer service person has different contradicting advice on what should/can be done and how to do it. The ""financial advisors"" don't want to touch RESPs with a ten foot pole and will ignore every time you try to talk to them, but you MUST make an appointment with them when you want to withdraw. You cannot do it at the branch.This last time I made an appointment, the guy I made the appointment with didn't bother to show up and another person called instead, she was very polite and went through the entire process - and then no money was ever transfered. So now it's the end of the month and I'm $3K short to pay my credit card. F&&& Scotiabank. Anyone have better ideas of where to bank?"
1852,Trust Pilot ,NA,"My partner is the estate executer for both of their parents. They ""closed"" the account on Feb 6, 2023 by an actual appointment. One week later they noticed the account was not closed and was charged $140 for late renewal fees. They called the bank about it and they had no scanned documents for death certificates or any information saying that it was closed. Even though a person from the bank scanned them in the in-person appointment. They now tell them they have to get an access code or a new card to close the account? No one knows how to close an account but they sure know how to charge one. These people are useless and TD Bank are just as bad."
1853,Trust Pilot ,NA,"My mortgage maturity day is June 24, 2023. I got an email reminded me to renew my mortgage online. I renewed online. But they changed my renewal date to Dec 5, 2022. This means they force me to start higher 5.72% rate on Dec 6, 2022 instead of June 24, 2023. I lost 7 month low 2% interest. That is a lot of money they sucked.I talk to the manager on my bank. They offer nothing but gave me instruction to contact their Escalated Customer Concerns Office Scotiabank. I emailed them and they refused to change the date or change back to my old mortgage.Bad bad bad service and just kick your customer here and there. NEVER solve anything!!!"
1854,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I did international money transfer online..can u imagine no receipt? Another party received payment with no details but with some nift/ citin numbers which bank never gave me.. couldn’t confirm. Called twice , 1 hr each:..customer service had no idea.. just repeating my questions wrongly.. when I said , May I talk to some senior, they put on hold for 15 mins and hanged on… still confused"
1855,Trust Pilot ,NA,Worse customer experience. For a big 5 you would think they invested in customer service. Had to call in and speak to 5 different reps to be given different information each time in order to set up a pre-authorized payment. Ridiculous and in the end to do so I have to visit a branch. Isn't it 2023 shouldn't they be able to do that over the phone? Certainly terrible.
1856,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I opened an online account last year, then I deposited some money by visiting the Richmond Hill branch(10850 yonge st.). Afterwards, I've been accessing the account online only. Today, I visited the branch to draw some money. But I couldn't because they said, they didn't have my information and just having the driver's license wasn't enough to identify me. They claimed that I needed to bring my passport as well because I opened the account online. So I ended up taking two trips.  I am very frustrated by this because I visited the branch to deposit when I opened my online account, so shouldn't they be able to identify me with my driver's license this time since it was second time visiting the same branch? Nobody carries around a passport when visiting the bank. There should be a better system to identify your customers."
1857,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Worse bank out of the major financial institutions and customer service are comprised of low IQ high school drop-outs....i waited over an hour to get through to client care....then the agent hung up on me for no apparent reason! I'm trying to file a complaint, but i will have to waste 2-3 hours of my valuable time just trying to get through!...worse banking experience i have had in a long time...i will be cancelling my accounts and move to another bank..."
1858,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Horrible banking. Government payments ALWAYS come AFTER all of the other banks deposit it. And payments go after holidays. No weekends. Horrible policies around customer service. Once put a $10,000 hold on my account over a weekend when no one could release it, because I owed $100-$200."
1859,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Awful awful awful awful awful awful awful awful awful awful… AWFUL. I can’t tell you all that i went through, but awful is what I can think of right now."
1860,Trust Pilot ,NA,Over 30 minutes waiting on the phone for someone to answer??!! Where are your employees??!!! No service I'm taking my money out to another bank!!! Goodbye bad services and lazy employees!!
1861,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotiabank and its entities are the worst banking experiences I have ever had.  It took them 9 weeks to transfer my mutual RRSP to another bank.  This resulted in me losing money by the day.  Afterwards, they accepted no responsibility.  Customer service is severely lacking with this institution.  Find another bank and stay away if you want to keep your money."
1862,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotiabank, Scotiatrust, ScotiaMcleod, avoid them like the plague. They are out for one thing and one thing only...your money. They co erced our mother into signing on the dotted line for a trust fund and we have been living a nightmare ever since. The lack of communication, the incompetence, it's a carousel of continual BS with these people."
1863,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Tried to open a simple high interest savings account online. After waiting almost 2 weeks for a client card I decided to go to my local branch and open the account. After confirming my account I was informed that my savings account was not the one offering the promotional rate and I also had a chequing account that would be charged a fee without a minimum $5000 balance. The teller then wanted me to make an appointment to see an advisor. When I asked to see the manager, the manager accused me of not listening to the teller. I then told them both to close my accounts and left. I don't understand why I needed to see an advisor just  to open a simple savings account?  I've done this on-line with many other banks. Scotia bank should get with the times. People don't always need or want to be told what to do with their money. The amount of waste of time and resource here is laughable!!"
1864,Trust Pilot ,NA,"They leave you high and dry while travelling outside of the country. Even if you buy breakfast with one of their credit cards for 10 euros, they block the transaction even after they've been advised that you're outside of the country and that you're going to use your card. Then you have to go through their whole security song and dance while waiting on hold. Useless bank. Moving my money over to someone else."
1865,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Never trust an institution that discriminates against its clients based on political opinion. If you are a client of ScotiaBank, divest yourself of all assets and find a new institution. We will only teach these people a lesson by hitting their bottom line."
1866,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I’ve been with this bank for 12 years everything was good until I have to apply for a mortgage, hoping that my loyalty will be considered but it was the other way around. I sent all the needed documents and was waiting for a response. It should only be 2-5 for the result to be generated but it was already 2 months and I keep on leaving voicemails, emails etc. until I decided to file a complaint, only to find out not from the branch itself but from the escalation team that my application was not approve. I’m like seriously? Is this how you treat your long time customers? I’m very DISAPPOINTED,MAD and FRUSTRATED, I never ever experience this. I was treated like a GARBAGE.they’re not ILLITERATE I guess…How hard is it to respond and say or email “your application was not approved “ end of story.  but NO I have to waste my time calling back and forth with no response. Even the complaint system of this bank is a Complete FAILURE. They’re saying they’re committed to resolve the complaints QUICK and EFFICIENTLY… what’s the definition of quick for this bank? Months? Years? Decades? You’ll only respond when there’s a missed/late payment but when it’s a customer concern you’re nowhere to be found. I’m really disappointed with this experience and definitely will not go back to this branch at FENNEL and UPPER GAGE avoid at all cost! YOU’VE BEEN WARNED!  Unless you have all the time to waste then go ahead."
1867,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Gave one star because zero was not available. I quit using scotia bank many years ago because they completely messed up my, business account, personal account and mortgages. Now (Dec 2022 to Feb 2023) I am trying to do a simple transfer of an old rrsp from scotia to another bank and they cannot even do that. A signed transfer form has been sent to them several times in the last two months and there has been zero response from scotia bank to the bank I now use. I have phoned 3 times and been told all kinds of ridiculous b.s. but still no transfer. I even went into my local branch to try and cash in the rrsp and the teller said the person I needed to see about this was busy but would phone me that same day. Guess what, this was over almost 2 weeks ago and I have not received a phone call. I am trying to get MY Money Back, (which they happily took from me) and they are doing everything they can to prevent this from happening.100% disgusted with this bank!"
1868,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Never, ever trust an institution that discriminated against its clients based on political opinion.  If you are a client of ScotiaBank, divest yourself of all assets and find a new institution.  The only way we will teach these people a lesson is by hitting their bottom line."
1869,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I rarely write customer service reviews, but the quality of service I received from Scotia Bank has simply been a nightmare. After a wait time of over 30 minutes twice, I was disconnected and had to call back a third time just for the simple task of ordering a set of new cheques. The customer service reps are extremely difficult to understand and lack the basic banking knowledge needed to assist customers properly - this leads to miscommunication and wasted time. Moreover, even with the voice recognition feature set up on my account, it took a long time to verify my identity and find my account. Complete nightmare. Bank elsewhere."
1870,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Tried to send a routine E-transfer for $150 to a recipient that I've sent multiple times over the years.  Phoned support when I didn't receive the confirmation email.  Waited on hold for 15 minutes, answered 4 security questions (correctly) and then was told my transfer has been put on hold and had to be transferred to the security department.  I waited on hold for 2.5 hours with the fraud department.  Come on guys!!!   You can do better than that!"
1871,Trust Pilot ,NA,have been going back and forth with Scotiabank customer service and I don't think any of them know they are the ones that links my Scotiabank Debit card to my Scene Plus number. No matter how I asked all of them thinks it is Scene Plus that links the cards. Have never dealt with terrible customer service
1872,Trust Pilot ,NA,Customer reps are not trustworthy. Unable to close my account and withdraw remaining balance. Stuck paying interest forever. Also they delete critical social media comments
1873,Trust Pilot ,NA,No thank you. When politicians can dictate where you are able to bank then something is seriously wrong. I closed all my accounts as of 3 today.
1874,Trust Pilot ,NA,Pure Evil!  If your a authoritarian NAZI or stalinist tyrant this is the bank for you!
1875,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotiabank is a disgusting organization. They have debanked a war veteran and father, for his political views. I will never do business with them."
1876,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Wish I could give -5 stars. The scotia bank cancelled all my business with them. The reason was I'm in my late 70's and not giving them any business. ie, I never use my line of credit, always pay off my Visa, and never go over my seniors discount on spending for bank charges."
1877,Trust Pilot ,NA,"So the scotiabank debanks a veteranAll bc of his freedom convoy actions and testified against the criminal Trudeau and his cronnies,...then someone calls  the SCOTIABANK and  they debank and screw a veteran for standing up for freedom for which this country used to stand for. I watched the video heard the bank guys own words, ""your banned from banks property and when mortgage due not renewing , 30 days before close accounts and also you need  get another bank to send your mortgage money to us for payment until nov 2024 then find a new mortgage lender."" THIS TRUDEAU TURNING FREE CANADA INTO A CHINA THAT HE IDOLIZES AND THIS TURN COAT BANK IS SUPPORTING THIS CRIMINAL TRUDEAU ACTIONS. I GUESS WE REALLY SEE HOW MUCH THEY CARE ABOUT CANADIANS. TYPICAL."
1878,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I went to the branch at 200 Portage Ave today to deposit a large cheque.  Diane, a teller in training, was very helpful, and what she didn't know, she got me the answers I needed.  My cash back is $2000 on cheques I deposit, the balance being held for clearing.  Diane and her associate were able to lift the cash back this time to $4000, so I could make an immediate payment on my Scotiabank Amex card.  I appreciate the time that Diane and her associates took to help me in a situation I found stressful.Kudos to the employees and the bank."
1879,Trust Pilot ,NA,"This bank isn't it. I have been with Scotiabank my whole life and it keeps getting worse and worse everyday/update. They changed the app to require two step verification and gives you no other options. Forces you to login to your phone three times and not two. In person banks have one or two tellers working, who are sometimes not nice at all. Business hours do not reflect for the business. The bank will change your account type without informing you or your permission, or giving you options which isn't fair to the customer. Students do not have any great offers or perks. Scotia scene points is worthless as you get a point which feels like every month."
1880,Trust Pilot ,NA,Mobile app doesn’t do statement notifications.  Hard to print as no way to do so for accounts.  Phoned customer service..very difficult to understand representative.  She said She couldn’t get into my account because I had not updated with my latest information. Nothing has changed. She told me to try again tomorrow I might be able to get on. There are extra credit cards showing on my account that I know nothing about it. Now I have to go to the bank.
1881,Trust Pilot ,NA,Scotiabank has to be 𝙩𝙝𝙚 worst bank to deal with. Instead of rectifying any difficulties with your account all they do is offer one excuse after another. All they do is tell you to call this number and that number only to be told to go to the brack to the branch. My dogs could do a better job.
1882,Trust Pilot ,NA,Bank itself is ok but the customer service is the worst especially in the branch located at surrey central station. Worst customer service. There are many staff members roaming around but nobody cares about the customers line up at front.
1883,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotia bank has to be the worst banking institution in Canada. They owe me over $20,000 and it has taken them over 5 weeks to get me my money. (And I’m still waiting!!). Every time I call them they make another excuse and say money is on its way. Even though I can pay them digitally, they somehow are unable to pay the same way!!!  Welcome to the 2000 Scotia bank. If I didn’t pay them $20,000 there would be massive repercussions, however, for them nothing!!! Awful institution, if you’re looking for a bank, keep looking this isn’t your place."
1884,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I find that there is an unusually long delay in transactions and payments to appear on my accounts on their website.  It is much longer than on my other bank accounts. I get almost immediate  notices if I spend on my other credit cards, so the information is there. It should not take a week to get posted to my online account. It makes it more difficult to manage when you have to reconcile for transactions that don’t show up. Don’t use Scotia if you need current balances to show in the website."
1885,Trust Pilot ,NA,"No star for it, never help when we got problems with account."
1886,Trust Pilot ,NA,Bad customer service. Long waiting time only to land on an inexperienced and annoyed agent does not know his stuff and does not listen to his customer. He redirected me to the wrong department and had to wait again for my turn. 2 hours on call only to stop a pre authorized contribution.
1887,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I have tried to contact their fraud department 3 times. First call 3 days ago, waited 45 minutes on ignore and then was told wrong department for commercial card. I called the number on the back of my card!Second call next day, waited an hour on hold and gave up.Third call today, used the phone number they e-mailed me with notification. Waited 45 minute and got the same wrong department. LOL Then, I am informed the department is closed today and not open for two more days. WOW! Great help. After 25 years of banking and other BS failures, I think I will be shopping for a new bank for commercial and personal."
1888,Trust Pilot ,NA,Hung up on me when they couldn't answer my question. Worst customer service ever.
1889,Trust Pilot ,NA,Worst bank ever. They have all these branches for nothing. I want to block one merchant changing me automatically. I have to renew the credit card for that. Silliest thing ever. They live in 12th century. Paypal will keep spanking the heck out of them with this narrow mindset
1890,Trust Pilot ,NA,WORST WORST BANK SCOTIABANK QUEEN AND MAIN ST BRAMPTON
1891,Trust Pilot ,NA,worst bank company in all of canada- they should change their name to let's rip the clients off. i opened a new account . it was immediately hacked and money that was frozen was allowed to be moved out. then they come after me for the missing money.
1892,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Customer service is not helpful at all, when you call the fraud department, you have to wait a lot of time and when you finally have someone answering, the person cannot give you proper information and just tell you the strict minimum which is already available on their website. Seriously thinking of changing bank."
1893,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I wanted to create a new account for int student, I tried to book an appointment for it, i got keep asking bank account number, credit card number, debit card number lots of unnecessary questions even i keep reminded them since i don’t have any account with Scotia bank then I wont have any of those informations. They asked me bank branch number or address, I told them they should know. They refused to know branches and locations for appointment. But I gave my location so they can find near by location. I disconnect call by informing them I will call again for next guy. I tried 3 times to book an appointment and finally a lady helped. But waste more than three hiurs Next day I was being late and had no enough time so tried to call to cancel or postpone the appointment. Story repeated as i mentioned above. Did waste almost same amount of time. So I went to branch and cancelled so they won’t wait me and at least next person will get help. My finding or personal views are 1)Train Staffs 2)Be accountable 3)Might need refreshments to Staffs 4)Measure quality not quantity 5)Customer is back bone if business. USELESS"
1894,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I emailed regarding a dispute on my charges and still not have heard back since December 20, 2022. They have been ignoring my emails.We emailed customer support email for Scotia bank"
1895,Trust Pilot ,NA,Wish I could give 0 reviews. Worth bank ever. Customer service sucks. Honestly save the trouble of having to switch banks and don’t even bother to go with this bank in the first place.
1896,Trust Pilot ,NA,WORST EVER CREDIT CARD COMPANY IN THE WORLD IS SCOTIABANK CREDIT CARDS. THEY WILL SAY EASY PAYMENTS BUT YOU WILL BE PAYING REST OF YOU LIFE TILL YOUR DEATH
1897,Trust Pilot ,NA,"This bank lost 2 of my US transfers, I called them daily no one ever answered the phone. I came in twice to speak to a manager who was always to busy to speak with me yet the bank is always empty. Promised to call me back, but never did. I forwarded my issues to the head office in Toronto where I was offered $300 meanwhile my $4000 US transfers still have not been found. I honestly can't believe a Canadian bank can be run so poorly and still be open."
1898,Trust Pilot ,NA,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Worst customer service I've ever had to deal with. A clump of dog dodo would give you better customer service then scociabank. They are not willing to help and they are very rude. Their app sucks more bananas then monkeys. If you want to constantly want to be late for making payments or always have trouble getting onto your online banking this is the bank for you. I've only been with them for 20 uears now, you think it would be easier or something I dunno. I just can't wait to switch banks. Thank you for a horrible 20 years with you."
1899,Trust Pilot ,NA,"My ""always commission free"" account has been charged with maintenance charges since months, and they refuse to close the account by phone. (no longer live in Chile).They are thieves."
1900,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Totally Unprofessional the overweight  female worker I think  is manager  flirts with the Spanish geek that's rude as hell,, and  that also. works there .....and They totally shut out customers needs..."
1901,Trust Pilot ,NA,"It's amusing how banks in Canada are charging monthly fees to have a basic debit/checking account.please tell me why having a minimum balance of $3/4K a month in the account will stop the fees but $1 less you , then will charged the full service charge?   A checking account is my money, why is scotiabank putting rules on how and when I use my account? Please learn from the UK. A checking/Debit account is completely free of charge."
1902,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Just waited 40 minutes to speak to someone about cashing in some TFSA and a second after they said hello, this is....the call was dropped!? TOTAL waste of time! give me my money you creeps! I am moving my accounts after 15 years of bad service. I think Scotia can afford a call back system like any respectful business has so their valued customers don't have to listen to the crap music they loop for 40 minutes. GRRRR!"
1903,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotiabank is incompetent and is a serious hindrance to my ability to get any online banking done.It is totally useless to interact with their online employees who will often just disappear, pretending to step away for a couple of min to get xtra help…and then simply not return!You cannot get past 2 step verification setup even though there is provision for you to do it later…you click on that prompt, are able to enter your email address and password and then…you’re right back to setup for 2SV and unable to go further.So I phoned a Scotiabank rep who assisted me with 2SV and it did not work!!So I downloaded the app which was total crap.Some of my payees for bills weren’t there so I had to add them again but when I entered my Visa card number and credit card # I kept getting a notice that the number was wrong even though it was the exact one that was on my card!And I was  unable to view my day’s activity like I was used to in online banking and. I could not print!!Disgusted and completely exhausted having to waste endless amounts of time getting nowhere.I will not put up with this much longer."
1904,Trust Pilot ,NA,Horrible bank making poor people even poorer. Shameful and disgusting banking practices.
1905,Trust Pilot ,NA,"The “worst bank” to deal with. Scotiabank needs to invest in human resource and business model. You cannot access the branch employees over the phone without a long wait on customer service help line. The banking system sucks, most of the time system freeze in the branch and you wait for it to reboot. And before that don’t forget a limited customer service personnel with confused looks as their banking procedures keep changing. This bank is just after deposits and deposits, NO CUSTOMER FOCUS and DO NOT VALUE YOUR BUSINESS."
1906,Trust Pilot ,NA,One of the worst bank I have bank with. Wait time for every matter with them is minimum 40 mins. I have screenshots to prove it and after waiting for this long the agent are so unprofessional they just disconnect the call. And I feel like my 4 years of banking with them went down the drain! PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM SCOTIABANK!
1907,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Watch your funds with Scotiabank.  We assumed our money was safe in a Scotia RRSP account (cash deposit) and could be withdrawn at any time.  What we found is repeated obstacles from all areas of Scotiabank that insisted on my having to schedule an appointment to ""update my information"" rather than accepting my simple decision to withdraw some of my own cash funds.  Their ""customer service"" call centres also just wanted to get additional information from me and refused to allow escalation to supervisor or manager levels.   Very suspect behaviour from a bank with our own cash funds for what should have been a very simple RRSP cash funds withdrawal."
1908,Trust Pilot ,NA,"If there is a negative start I would give scotiabank one. They have the worst customer service I have experienced. I applied for a credit card due to the promotion that they had for the 10% cashback. I had a huge purchase coming up which makes sense for me to get the card. I called their customer service to confirm that my purchase qualifies for the 10% cashback and they confirmed. After purchasing over $20,000 worth of product I only got under $500 cashback. I also had some issues with disputes where I had to call them more than 5 times, sent multiple emails with the same information and still no update from them. My last conversation with their dispute team is asking for the same information I've already provided. Their customer service and dispute team is a joke. Im sure people will still get products from this company, but read this before you do."
1909,Trust Pilot ,NA,everything on the phone all day they removed 5000k in error from my account and never helped to resolve issues. error with telephone banking.  bill payment was to be 510 they took out 5510 plus change.
1910,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I have never deal with a Bank with such a bad service in my whole life (I am 64)I had a online sign/log in issue with them since 2 months ago, but until today, still could not be resolved, I have spent hours on the phone, talking to at least 6-7 people on the phone after listening to their music at least 30 minutes each time, and I was told to go the branch for a number of times and I did, and when I went to the branch, branch staffs told me they could not help me again and again, I have been back and forth running around but still nothing was resolved.It looks like to me either the online or Brach staffs don't have any idea what they are doing to my opinion ???I am just speechless , I can't find any other words that I can describe how terrible about Scotia Bank, the way that they handled Customer's problem was/is absolutely terrible and ridiculous to my experience and opinion, I wish their Customer Service Department can read this e-mail and give me a feed back , but I am not hopefully at all with my experience."
1911,Trust Pilot ,NA,I’m not a customer but I do get regular emails from the bank telling me about the balance on the account that I don’t have. No response to my efforts to get this miscommunication corrected. Given up now and just delete the emails clearly intended for one of the bank’s actual (and no doubt “valued”) customers.
1912,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Ghosting by successive staff ( including branch mgr ) around a simple request. Must be really bad working there, that’s all I can think of.. yikes"
1913,Trust Pilot ,NA,If you report a fraudulent transaction to Scotiabank not only will they not do anything for you but they will keep the money that was fraudulently transacted through them. Basically this is a criminal bank
1914,Trust Pilot ,NA,"They do have one thing going for them -  being part of the Global ATM Alliance.  If you travel outside Canada, you can access your bank account with no service charges.Otherwise, I can't see any advantage over other Canadian banks, and they may well be worse.  The pandemic has habitually highlighted their rudeness.  Their ""support"" staff are often worthless."
1915,Trust Pilot ,NA,
1916,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Dealing with a fraudulent situation and the lack of compassion or support from this bank is ridiculous. Went to the branch manager to speak to him and he started things on his end but told me I needed to call the fraud the department. Call, wait 30 minutes and the first person tells me that she cannot do a thing and transfers me to someone else. That person hangs up. Call again, wait 20 minutes and the guy on the phone basically tells me in a round about way it has nothing to do with the bank when it fully does. Its their name being used, my account and information from this bank. Would not recommend using this bank whatsoever"
1917,Trust Pilot ,NA,"We were dealing with a financial advisor at Scotia Bank for our mortgage.  With rising interest rates, we decided to sell a major asset to pay down our mortgage with the intent to reduce our payment.  The financial advisor told us we could reduce our payment by $200-$300 dollars.  When we finally arranged to make the payment against the principle, we found out our advisor was no longer with the branch.  We ended up dealing with a trainee who had to have a (I assume) manager to help him deposit the principle payment.  After the deposit they sent us a statement in them ail several days later only to find out that they did NOT reduce our payment but only reduced the payment term.  We are now paying a much higher mortgage payment and they are telling us we cannot have a lower payment.  They lied to us and used our money in a manner to reduce their risk.  This is the worst banking service we had ever received.  Having lied to us we want them to terminate the renewal date so we can go elsewhere.  I strongly recommend avoiding Scotia Bank as they are not helping us at all."
1918,Trust Pilot ,NA,I deposited my paycheque directly at the teller and they withheld my funds. Not the first time either. I’m not sure what the teller is supposed to click on their damn computer screen but geez realize people have to pay bills. I spent 20 minutes to drive there and deposit directly to avoid this during their crappy business hours and still it was withheld. I hate this bank and will be changing immediately. Prince George BC.
1919,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I'm a business owner who does variety of different banking transactions.  I've been with RBC for over 20 years and have recently taken some business over to Scotiabank.  What a MASSIVE difference!!  RBC has been failing miserably in the service department, (and I keep a large balance in two currencies - I should be a top customer).   Scotiabank's tellers and managers are far more efficient, polite and business friendly!"
1920,Trust Pilot ,NA,These people are very bureaucratic and just try to avoid taking the right action. They want you to spend hours contacting one branch or the other for getting the work done. Not at all helpful. Even to close my account and transfer remaining balance they had to really waste so much of my time. Pathetic customer service.
1921,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Been trying to access money in my account but there’s no way, I have been on the phone countless times still nothing, they book appointments but they don’t even call you on the appointment date as promised, it’s extremely ridiculous"
1922,Trust Pilot ,NA,"2 hours and counting waiting to speak to the fraud department rep.  Likely more fraud being committed while I waste my life waiting in line.  Unacceptable that a bank earning $2,540,000,000 dollars last quarter (Net Income...had time to look it up) ldoes not even staff appropriately and puts customers through this that pay their bills."
1923,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Worst bank ever, switching out asap.  After they fired my decades-long advisor, they neglected to give me a new one.  I spent hours just to get an appointment to settle an estate -- simple RRIF with named beneficiary -- hour and a half of my time wasted to fill out and sign papers with a newbie that kept asking the manager how to do things.  That was in May. Now in October I get a snail mail that they are missing estate information and I have to make an appointment to provide that missing info, except the letter did not specify what info they are missing. Brilliant move to waste more of my time. Note this is six months after the estate papers were submitted. So I try calling the bank to make another appointment -- wait time to get to talk to an agent over an hour, no callback like Rogers has, you get to listen to crappy music. When I finally talk to someone, I get the full security detail questions, including the balance on my account (which I don't know because the card they gave me does not work online, yet another issue), just to make a stupid appointment I don't really want to go to but have to because some newbie screwed up my paperwork. Do they know that at TD, you can just book an appointment online, all they ask is your name, email and why you want to see an advisor... done in less than 5 minutes.These are only some of my more recent complaints. In the past year, they set my mother's maiden name to blank so I couldn't get past security questions -- hours and hours of frustration.  The new card card they give me does not register for online access. They renewed my  GIC when I explicitly told them not to.  I couldn't transfer money out of my non-registered accounts online. When that was finally fixed, the transaction just disappeared -- I could not tell whether it went through or not until it showed up in my chequing account three business days later. Why it takes that long is beyond me.  Scotiabank technology is sooo behind everyone else's it's not even funny.  They think they can save time by getting rid of experienced advisors and replace them by newbies who screw up and waste everyone's time. Instead of getting the personal service I was used to, done quickly and efficiently, I get to wait to talk to some overseas person who just follows a very badly designed script.  By the way, I had to open an estate account while I am waiting for the bank estate department to act. They charge $4 every month for doing absolutely nothing -- no transactions whatsoever -- while paying no interest.Why anybody in their right mind would put up with this kind of service is beyond me.  Why whoever is in charge of the bank IT department still has a job is a mystery.  Advice to anyone who still banks at Scotiabank: switch to any other bank asap. And if you own Scotiabank stock, sell."
1924,Trust Pilot ,NA,This bank does not look out for their customers needs. Customer service poor.
1925,Trust Pilot ,NA,If I could gave 0 star I would it’s a joke no professionalism rude customer service and not knowledgeable you wait on the ligne for and stay on call for at least 1 hour and yet the problem is not solved i ben lying too as I work most of the time I gave my availability for a phone call asking for a call back the customer said ok i send a request for a call back and guess what no one called so to have someone on the ligne you need to called keep in mind that I ben hang up on twice so you need to take one full day to stay on the phone I ben lied to and hang up on
1926,Trust Pilot ,NA,"If I could give this rating a BIG Zero, I would gladly.Today, I have experienced the worst customer experience in my entire life. those employees working over there are unprofessional and clearly need extensive training. Today I called around 11:00 AM and after long waiting, the employee answered she denied access to my account based on GENDER identity, can you believe that!!!!! she asked me if I am a male or female and when I answered  I am a female she said sorry but there's MR in front of your name which is a male!!!!! told her who put that well clearly I did not, She replied I can not access your account because of that, and this is what the security is based on !!! Be real people, this girl or lady needs to be trained from scratch.I hope her managers could take action towards that if they do care about keeping their customers.Note: Just wanted to clarify the date in case the Scotiabank managers care to investigate. This incident happened today October 27, 2022, not sure why when I chose October 27, 2022, insist on making it October 26, 2022."
1927,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Give this Bank big 0. Made night deposit in June/2022.Two weeks later, no credit in my account. Went to my Branch was told they will look into it. Weeks later, nothing. Left Branch manager phone message, nothing. Phoned Customer service took my issue down, weeks later, nothing. Went back to Branch, talked to Manager, "" we looked everywhere, things balanced"" there is no indication you have made the deposit. Got hold of my Pension department-who send me the cheque. Pension send me copy of the chequeindicating it was cashed by a back stamp from Scotia Bank. Still busy trying to get my money. After this, I am closing ALL ACOUNTS. I have enough of their BS."
1928,Trust Pilot ,NA,"If I could give a zero I would.  Trying to deal with my mother's estate, going on weeks with no return communication.  This bank has zero customer service."
1929,Trust Pilot ,NA,This bank is working against middle class and low class people I own a used car business and they refused to enroll me in their financing program claiming that it’s only for franchise stores I urge all people to pull their money out from this bank it appears it’s only for rich people F..ck you
1930,Trust Pilot ,NA,Worst fc$kin$g call centre you will ever find
1931,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Terrible service.I've had a Visa account with Scotiabank since 1993 and they just decided to arbitrarily cancel it due to inactivity.  No notice was given to me prior to cancelling.  They just closed it.  So I called them up and, after waiting 20 minutes to reach someone, told them to reinstate it and they gave me a song and dance about how it's impossible to reopen and I'd have to reapply.  Are you kidding me?  I escalated the issue and the alleged manager there told me she'd investigate it.  A few days later I received two envelopes in the mail (both with the same postmark date).  One of them told me the investigation had been opened, while the other told me the investigation was closed because they did nothing wrong.  What the hell kind of nonsense is this?So then I contacted the Office of the President (which is supposed to take complaints) and got through to no one (of course), so I left a voice message.  It's been weeks and no one has called me.Additionally, I've asked these clowns for a missing statement copy on my other Visa account three times now over the past several weeks.  Nothing has been received.This bank is a joke."
1932,Trust Pilot ,NA,"If there is less than 1 star, I would choose it. I'm trying to close my wife's credit card for weeks as she is deceased. Unable to talk to anyone-no human interaction!!Publish an email address or hire more people"
1933,Trust Pilot ,NA,"An absolutely abysmal bank. Thanks to their snail speed with wire transfers, I'm in serious financial hardship, waiting like an idiot for my paycheck, struggling to eat. Where is my money Mr Scotiabank CEO? Some of us need an income to survive. We need a reset button on banking."
1934,Trust Pilot ,NA,"The online app didn't update my credit card transactions for 5 days. Called the bank, was told the card was overdraft, which doesnt happen on a credit card of a student account, that too without any prior notification. Doesn’t give you any reason, nor transfers you to someone who can help. Horrible customer service. Tanked my credit history of 5 years, bounced my car insurance payments."
1935,Trust Pilot ,NA,"the most horrible experience ever. can't access my money, make money transfer. Called agent, after 45 mins he's trying to instruct me how to create payee or lying to me that i can't make any transfers as i am not physically in Canada - asked to transfer to manager - refused. HORRIBLE"
1936,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I am seriously so frustrated and angry that I am writing this review.... requested a card, and it is sent to a completely different location that you specifically mentioned that you do not have access to. Call customer service, they block your card putting up a fake reason that the card was stuck in ABM machine. 1 call and 5 different times authentication. Scotia is such a nasty bank where training your the employees is not a practical thing at all. they do not have solutions designed for customer's needs considering that the customer is stuck and literally, is requesting their own (not fraud, not unethical, not someone else's money) I myself am a victim of financial fraud what help am I getting from then '0' there are 5 different issues that I need help with from Scotia and none of them had been successfull."
1937,Trust Pilot ,NA,horrible bankidiot staffno customer service\govt must shut down this bank
1938,Trust Pilot ,NA,"The mortgage department is horrible. The mortgage agent are not trained and have zero finance knowledge at the Whitby branch. if you call the head office try to get someone from Maritime provinces. It will save you time. Otherwise, solutions you will get are not outside of box, shows you can read  about it online and come up with it yourself. I would recommend going to BMO, TD, RBC or any other bank. SCOTIA IS RED FOR A REASON A RED FLAG. CUSTOMER SERVICE was horrible they tossed me around to collection, credit card, complaint office. After 4 hours, I spoke to mortgage agent. Who had not clue what to do and told me call back again."
1939,Trust Pilot ,NA,Don't put your money in this bank.  They take money off from your account without your knowledge and no explanation.  You call the bank and they would not tell you anything but go to the branch.  I went to the branch and they could not tell me anything. I was told to speak to one of the financial advisors and no one was available.  No one could help me.  Making an appointment is like pulling teeth.  Ridiculous wait times on the phone and worst customer service ever.  Bank hours is ridiculous.  I have to take half a day off from work to make it to their banks that close at 4PM.  Take your money somewhere else.  Don't bank at Scotiabank.
1940,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Over 3 decades, always at least 45 minute wait for all customer service calls (i.e. no customer service), & staff regularly give false or incomplete bank policy information."
1941,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Worst company and definitely the worst bank to deal with. Not even a customer but have to deal with them on behalf of my mother. Rude, unprofessional and stupid staff. Stay away!!!!"
1942,Trust Pilot ,NA,"YES, today I was having a problem with my app then I talked to the person JANES and he was so lovely and handle me excellently. He handled my problem in such an excellent way. I am so glad that he helped me and even I told him to change some of my information also and he also did that very quickly because of him I can log in again and he even give me some answers very nicely. his nature was friendly. I really liked the way he talk to me. it was impressive. THANK YOU JANE FOR HELPING ME OUT."
1943,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Tried to send an interac transfer to my SO (who has sent and received money from me before), Scotiabank decides today's the day they're going to block the transfer without offering an explanation or initial check before just blocking it. After talking to multiple chat advisors, nobody could give me an answer and told me ""call this number, they know"" Guess what! A 2 HOUR wait before I spoke to a single person. I had to wait and listen to their awful music, and had to spend almost another hour before it could be resolved. I went to the branch the next day and withdrew my funds, closing my account. What an absolute awful bank and an awful experience. This was the final straw after numerous ""____ service will not be available from M-F"" ""Interac is currently down"" ""There was an error logging you in"" ""Sorry, can't complete the request right now"", not to mention the EXTENDED amount of time you have to wait for refunds, payments to reflect, or anything being processed versus other banks. I encourage everyone to explore their options outside of Scotiabank."
1944,Trust Pilot ,NA,Absolutely pathetic bank. Customer service is practically inexistent. If you cant answer the phone even after someone's waited for 3 HOURS!! then what is the need to have such a department?If someone has a fraud issue don't even bother to ask for help because there isn't any. I REGRET being a Scotiabank client.
1945,Trust Pilot ,NA,trying to contact customer services is a joke. wait times usually up to 45minutes to 1hr.
1946,Trust Pilot ,NA,Yerlin Fernandez is the call centre supervisor. He is absolutely the rudest person I have ever dealt with. He will gaslight you and make you feel like you’re in the wrong even if you have proof of transactions that took place with the date and time. I have been with Scotiabank for more than 13 yrs  and after todays phone call I am leaving Scotiabank for good!
1947,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I’m with Scotiabank for 12 years and I had enough. The worst bank to deal with. Customer service and consultants for the online banking are very unhelpful. You have to wait for an hour to connect with someone and you will advise to go to the branch. I will not continue dealing with this bank at all. Aba the agent and his consultant asked my personal details, last 3 transactions, total of my transactions prior to that, my mother’s maiden name, SIN number, last 3 digits at the back of my card and this is ridiculous. Not worth talking to their front line, they’re just wasting time. They deserve a zero star at all!"
1948,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Worst bank ever. For passport renewal, we asked them money order. They issued the draft. We sent whole documents needed for our passport to USA (Canada doesn't have embassy of our country). The embassy couldn't proceed the money order due to the technical problem with the Scotia bank. We obtained a ticket for the delay of money order, and a delay in receiving our documents as I am an international student in Canada!!"
1949,Trust Pilot ,NA,After 30 years with Scotiabank I've had enough.  Waiting for a transfer from one account to another.... been 2 weeks with still no access to my money. Changing banks asap. Avoid Scotiabank at all costs people
1950,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Such a very bad service, short stuff, waiting over the phone more than 45 min, no knowledge, they don’t have any idea about the bank product even simple things, keep put me on hold and ask others. I will close my account and move to other bank."
1951,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Just horrible. 3 ppl working the counter on a Friday at 12:30 pm, and 1 won’t even help customers. Oh by the way there is 12 ppl in line. The give zero sh1tes about you. Happy I’m closing my account and going to my other bank. Stay away from scotiabank at al costs."
1952,Trust Pilot ,NA,"And I feel very strongly that every time I speak to one of their agents, this person is incredibly incompetent. Which so weird, because I generally feel like everyone is amazing and can do anything. But just they're not even below average, they don't understand or remember anything I say.They are simply the worst and least reliable bank in Canada. Please don't use them. For your own sake, use any other bank. I'm begging you."
1953,Trust Pilot ,NA,"They mislabeled and misidentified me multiple time even tho I had to keep telling them I am a mam not a sit please do not refer to me that way But when it kept happening I was frustrated and said can you stop f*ing calling me a man please I am a woman and do not appreciate it at allThen I was told since I swore in the bank that they have to close my account and give me my money back, which I was down there to begin with because I wanted my money out because I just made the account today deposited all my cash and then left to go get my prescription before the store closedYet when I tried to pay with card it said card not active my app said I did not have an account active either yet I could see my money amount So I had to borrow money to pay the taxi and then walk back down 5 km when I’m a motorcycle accident victim and shouldn’t be moving much like thatI don’t get it if it was an employee and a job they would have to reimburse the employee yet again they make a mistake and it costs me moneyThat’s not right she said so herself that she made a mistake and did not activate my account So she’s in the wrong yet I get my account taken away for one word when they said sir many more times and that’s much more hurtful to call a woman sir than to mutter the f word under your breath"
1954,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Waited 45 minutes for a rep. They didn't take a call back #, we got disconnected in the first two minutes.Looking at another 45 minutes on the phone ... this bank SUCKS"
1955,Trust Pilot ,NA,The Scotiabank Dilworth branch in Kelowna must be the worst bank branch ever judging from other reviews. I thought I was alone that I will go to another branch even if if is farther. There is no access to iATMs after regular hours. They put one accessible outside but it does not work. And the screen is exposed to the sun so that it is very difficult to read what is on the screen. This branch continues to be a disaster and the people working there do not care.
1956,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I've been on the phone waiting for a totally of 4.5 hours so far, beening passed around to person to person, i'm still on the phone waiting (not joking) because of a fraud purchase of $2.67usd, unlock my banking account so can pay bills, (I cant use my cell phone because of this problem) send me a new card in the mail."
1957,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Don't get your card lost or stolen, as scotiabank will not return any money used by the people who use it for fraudulent purchases, it's a hassle just explaining stuff to people who aren't fluent in English."
1958,Trust Pilot ,NA,Someone stole money from my debit card. Waited 2 hrs to reach the fraud department for Scotiabank. Couldn't help me at the end because apparently I answered one security question wrong and he didn't even want to tell me which question was that 🙂. Wasted 2 hrs for nothing and now I have to go the branch.
1959,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotia is the worst. They've once lost an RRSP divestment and then MAILED me a check from the government to them instead of returning it to the government - which is super illegal.None of their departments understand what the other departments handle or are capable of doing. I've once spent 2 hours on the phone with them and got pass from one department to another to another to another and back to the first department. And the thing is every time I talk to them I tell them specifically what's wrong and suggest options for fixing it, and every time THEY IGNORE 99% of what I say and suggest something stupid, like let's clear the cookies or let's double check your using the right login name. And I feel very strongly that every time I speak to one of their agents, this person is incredibly incompetent. Which so weird, because I generally feel like everyone is amazing and can do anything. But just they're not even below average, they don't understand or remember anything I say.They are simply the worst and least reliable bank in Canada. Please don't use them. For your own sake, use any other bank. I'm begging you."
1960,Trust Pilot ,NA,At least 45 minutes in wait time for customer service... Sh!t bank.. I hate it
1961,Trust Pilot ,NA,
1962,Trust Pilot ,NA,This is by far the worst treatment from any bank I have received. After charging me 2 late payment fees for 2 credit cards I paid 3x more than the minimum payment balances they still manage ro steal from my accounts over $800.00 in payments that were already made by myself. I contacted the number you call for assistance only to be told that's not their issue but my branch issue to resolve. I am done with Scotiabank. Give me back my money and stop altering the times I made my online transactions. That's fraud. God don't sleep.
1963,Trust Pilot ,NA,This bank just like all of them are have no customer service. The service is the worst ever. Cant get intouch with anyone that knows anything. The app for banking online changes do you cant even see where to do a simple bill payment. Same as the machines. You cant even read the screens they took allthe bold out and put in fine print and lines you cant even see. Machines now paperless doesnt reas checks to deposit . Spits most back out. And dont read bills when u want to do a cash deposit. Just pathetic
1964,Trust Pilot ,NA,I wouldn’t even give this bank a 1 if I had a choice! I had a credit card with them and would receive up to 12 calls a day if I was even 25.00 dollars short on a payment ( unintentionally) which I couldn’t answer because I was at work and they never left a message. I went into the bank a few weeks ago to pay it off the card and the clerk said all was done and cut up my card  in front of me. Today I received a bill or 106.00! I know they don’t care and this was a long ramble but I feel it had to be said.
1965,Trust Pilot ,NA,Absolutely awful.  I dread having to do anything with this bank.  Just randomly had my debit card canceled and no access to my bank account.  They are the WORST. I also bank with another bank and they are so much better.
1966,Trust Pilot ,NA,This is quite possibly the worst bank that I have ever experienced.  I am trying to GIVE them money to pay off a vehicle loan.  They are difficult to deal with and incredibly arrogant to the point where I am in disbelief of my own experience with them. I inherited Scotiabank when I bought a new vehicle from a dealership - sure glad that I don't bank with them.
1967,Trust Pilot ,NA,"By far the worst customer service ever.Made my e-transfer disappear and their fraud department is now telling  me to wait 24 to 48 hours before the issue could resolve itself.Their customer service representatives are unable to explain why there was an issue in the first place after multiple phone calls. Can't give me their full name or id number of any sort so I can hold this person liable after waiting on the phone for over a hour. Can't get me to speak to anyone else that is a step above like a supervisor. When asked to speak to a supervisor I  was told to wait 24 to 48 hours to hear back from one.So this business literally just took my e-transfer money and is now refusing to give it back for 24 to 48 hours like a big bully. What a shame!Quick update. It now has been over 3 business days and still don't have my e-tranfer money that magically went poof or haven't heard from a supervisor in 24 to 48 hours as it was promised.On hold for for over 40 minutes now, waiting to speak to yet another fraud analyst. I believe I am the one that needs a fraud analyst at this point if you ask me instead of this business."
1968,Trust Pilot ,NA,This app is god forsaken. My blood pressure has increased from using this app. Their 2-factor authentication works half the time only and this has occured on multiple devices. Only do business with this bank if you want your money and your access to it to be played with. These are not human beings running this company they are spineless rats.
1969,Trust Pilot ,NA,
1970,Trust Pilot ,NA,That's worst banking I ever seen I know that doesn't matter for them but I will make sure you will not get more customers from immigration for sure you will see something decrease for sure
1971,Trust Pilot ,NA,Worst customer support you have to wight minimum of 1 hour to talk to a representative.
1972,Trust Pilot ,NA,I would have given them a zero if that was possible. Their customer service is the worst. Be ready to be stuck in a call for 1.5-2 hrs even if the matter is urgent. Really frustrated with their service.
1973,Trust Pilot ,NA,Their app and website are infuriating.  Jump through tons of hoops.  You never get what you need.  Thats after the huge hassle of trying to sign in. Nothing but a circle of endless problems.  I’m moving from this backwards banks to another.  They definitely can’t be any worse.
1974,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Got a Scotiabank Scene+ Credit Card in anticipation of Sobeys changing over from Airmiles. Great, right? Wrong. Scene+ account doesn't link. Didn't even have one autogenerated when I activated the card. Asked Scotiabank about it and their response was 'we don't handle Scene+ accounts'. Ok, great. But it's a Scene+ card.Will cancel and take business elsewhere."
1975,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I agree with all the 1 star reviews of this bankSTAY AWAY FROM THIS BANK, THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ABSOLUTE TRASH.They do not care about you AT ALL.They are rude and less then helpful."
1976,Trust Pilot ,NA,"As a retired Scotiabanker, I’m totally disgusted with the level of service I have been getting. The “customer service” function of the bank is one sick joke. The customer complaints process is also one sick joke. The fact that Euromoney named Scotiabank the No.1 bank in Canada is mind-boggling. Executive Management needs to do the job to restore the level of customer service to an ACCEPTABLE level.AUGUST 27, 2022 UPDATE:It has been weeks since The Office of The President “acknowledged receipt” of my complaint and to date, no one has responded to me."
1977,Trust Pilot ,NA,I dont have words to explain how horrible my experience with scotia bank has been. They seem very uneducated in troubleshooting a situation or how to fix it and they also take an extreme amount of time to do anything required or asked of. Waste of time and waste of patience.
1978,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Scotiabank doesn’t protect its cardholders from fraud and identity theft and favours merchants that don't guarantee to protect their customers’ privacy and don't comply with PCI DSS. STAY AWAY FROM THIS BANK, THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ABSOLUTE TRASH."
1979,Trust Pilot ,NA,"so I called to cancel a lost visa, but they cancelled my DEBIT card, which locked me out of everything. I tried calling to sort it out, but literally couldnt understand the rep on the phone.  So now i have to wait for the card to come in the mail, someday... and until then i cant access the money in my account, i cant tell if they cancelled the missing visa, nothing. I hope someone finds it and racks up thousands because I will sue.  I wish I knew of a bank where the call centers had to have a basic grasp of common canadian languages."
1980,Trust Pilot ,NA,"If I could give zero stars I would. It is very clear that BNS make up their ""policies"" as it suits them. I am a CAF veteran of 30 years, I have significant experience moving and understanding mortgages. After retirement, we renewed our mortgage to a closed variable with an emphasis on fixing our payments but rate hikes would extend the term. We have no been told ""bluntly"" from Amanda that those mortgages don't exist. As all calls are recorded we have asked to review the call log and we need a lawyer to hear it but they can review it. So, if we did say that, which we did can you fix the payment? We are waiting but if that policy doesn't exist how can you fix it? All the other 6 major banks do it. Shame on you Scotia bank, I am embarrassed to call myself a Scotian now. Because you clearly don't make enough profit you need to screw the little guys.....please share this on any and all social media, I will be.Matt"
1981,Trust Pilot ,NA,45 mins wait time. How is that a good customer service I mean I know ya’ll really don’t care about us customers but just need the money! Horrible horrible worse than rogers! I couldn’t log into my account even with the right password and simply asks me to call you guys up. What a JOKE man absolute trash. Will be writing up an amazing blog about how ya’ll exploit your poor customers
1982,Trust Pilot ,NA,Bad services wait time is upto 45 min.after 45 min someone picked up my called name Harry and said he is not able to access my account and I need to call again.
1983,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I was sitting in line behind a young gentleman in a wheelchair. The accessibility counter is full with plants and other things. This guy was a champ about dealing with his challenges with his great attitude and I'm sad to even see that the entire staff saw him waiting in line behind 6 others and never bothered to move and accommodate him.  Cheers pal, you were a gentleman to a group of uncaring bank people."
1984,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Heard a lot of bad things about Scotiabank with many friends and family leaving them for other banks. Thought I would give them a shot because they had a lot of promotions, but that's where the good things end.Lack of customer service, billing error, long wait-times over the phone (over 70 minutes), can't withdraw money from ATM..."
1985,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Worst banking experience ever. I use this bank but have had nothing but disappointments since I opened the account. First they sell you the wrong product as new immigrants, second they charge exorbitant fees for services and you really have to keep an eye on your account and query everything just to be sure you’re not being ripped of. My disappointment rose to the peak when I made an international money transfer from my online banking, as I’ve done with other banks. The money was reverted back by the receiving bank, yet Scotiabank appears not to be able to trace the money in their system. Took the receiving bank only two emails to their customer care and a few days the money was traced back to Scotia Bank. It has now been well over two years and Scotia Bank is still not able to come to a conclusive outcome with the trace.Can money transfer just disappear like that, I asked the Kitchener(King street) branch manager? To which she coldly replied, yes, money can disappear like that when you transfer online. The ombudsmen response was even more shocking, they said, the recipient MIGHT have received the money. I then send more concrete evidence from the receiving bank and now Scotia Bank has placed me in limbo for over five months now. What a scam of a bank."
1986,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Absolutely disgusted with their inefficiency and their ridiculous wait times. I was waiting for 45 minutes before i got a hold of an agent and once in, i had to be transferred to 5 different agents. The agent on the phone reassured me that if the call disconnected i would get a call back, eventually the call did end abruptly and i did not receive a call back. The call lasted a whole HOUR and 10 minutes. Each and every single employee made me repeat myself and my situation + security questions i had ALREADY answered numerous times. I have been frauded TWICE through scotiabank i do NOT recommend. I was refunded the first time but the second time i was not since i was told i “authorized” canadian transactions on my phone. How are you blaming YOUR CLIENT for being frauded ?? Ridiculous. Needless to say i am changing banks as soon as possible."
1987,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Although once a great bank, Scotiabank Panama has become one of the worst banks in the country. Customer Service is non-existent. Whether you call or email, there is rarely a response and never a resolution of the problem. I would NOT recommend Scotiabank to anyone looking to open accounts. I am presently in the process of ending my 7-year relationship as an account holder."
1988,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I asked to transfer my investments to another bank in December 2021, now end of June and they still didin t transfer all my investments, always a problem,When I transfered it to Scotia maybe 10 years ago it took 3 weeks. What the hell is the problem. Tried to phone at my bank in Laval and tried all options and always get a recorded message. Had to go down ther in person and that s in April and they were suppoosed to take care of this. Never will I go back to this bank in the futur. I phoned the head office to complain, they sent me a message that they will get back to me in the next 90 DAYS. A real joke and very bad customer service."
1989,Trust Pilot ,NA,"The customer service is just a ridiculous, they asked me 10 questions just to be able to update my address, after I waited 25mins to get hold of them. What a great way to ruin your day!"
1990,Trust Pilot ,NA,"We, an international NGO headquartered in Canada, have an account in Scotiabank since 2005, which since 2018 is fully operated by online token only.A First series of frauds happened in 2019 - 16 fraudulent cheques, Total loss:  CAD 3351 booked in contrary to our service agreement, which allowed no cheques. This series was fully settled 2 months later, while disconnecting the account access for 4 more months. A second series of fraud with a total of approx. 3000 CAD happened between 4/2020 and 8/2021, connected to a GST/provincial payment Canada scheme and ebay transactions, whilst we hold no ebay account. The cases could be closed only after the police fraud contol went in to review the case.The branch manager was  not available, not by phone, not by email not calling back, not answering anything, so was the whole branch.  The escalation procedure desribed by the bank intentionally does not work, there is no client feedback involved and the communication by email is neither answered nor even receipt confirmed. No follow up, no service time, no fix process or committments at all.Now, when we had sent in the request to close to account in March, when the account online access was again revoked , the bank tries to request ""service fees"" for non-services. A nightmare, not a bank. Go somewhere else if you can."
1991,Trust Pilot ,NA,Don't EVER trust this sham of a bank with any financial matters.  A blindfolded monkey would do a better job!!!  And good luck speaking with anyone who cares about you being a client.   DISGUSTING!!!!!
1992,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Definitely do NOT switch to Scotiabank. I'm with Scotiabank and this just happened to me: I sent a simple e-transfer and they froze everything.After getting ahold of Scotia at their regular phone number, they transferred me and I spent two hours waiting for Scotia's fraud department while listening to the same jingle on repeat that they haven't changed since the 90s (estimate).Finally, they answered the phone and a guy starts asking me questions. I got his first ~5+ questions correct, however somehow, the absolute moron said that my passport number and driver's license were incorrect, and that he is immediately further locking all my accounts and that if I ever want to use my accounts again, I need to go into a branch. Right now I'm inconveniently far from a branch, so I needed to plan one of my entire days off just to mission to a branch, only to find out that the driver's license and passport they have on file are in fact exactly the numbers I told the guy on the phone.While in the branch, the employees themselves were super confused at my dumpster fire scenario and it took most of an hour to call the fraud department with the employees present and then issue me new cards. It was the worst overall customer experience I've ever had.To the dude that was working the phones late on Saturday, June 11 2022 in Scotiabank's fraud department, go fist yourself.Story #2: they sent my latest credit card to the completely wrong branch even after I called them twice and 'verified' that it wouldn't be sent there, and that it would be sent to a branch near me."
1993,Trust Pilot ,NA,I left Scotia Bank years ago because of terrible customer service. I see it has not changed. I have been with First Calgary (now Connect First) and they have been beyond great. Plus I don’t pay any monthly fees.
1994,Trust Pilot ,NA,"No call back option when trying to speak with customer service which takes forever to get through, overall really disappointing banking experience for so many other reasons."
1995,Trust Pilot ,NA,"This bank is rude, their customer service is not existent unless you go in and even THEN you are supposed to have an appointment.I had a fraud perpetrated on my credit card, the woman who called me back was reprehensibly rude and she PROMISED a new card in 3-5 days.  It's been three weeks.  My prime is cancelled, my other monthly charges are also at risk and all of this at a GREAT inconvenience to me.  I was at the Beddington Branch in Alberta and the manager who has since left was quizzing people in the line demanding to know if they were employed.  I should have left then.  The second I can, I am OUT OF THIS BANK."
1996,Trust Pilot ,NA,"Their online banking system is totally dysfunctional and the fact that absolutely nobody - from call centres, to Twitter, to local bank accountant to service manager - can help me is simply unacceptable. A modern bank without a functioning online system should not be allowed to continue operating. My money is now impossible to access and i consider it as theft."
1997,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I just switched to Scotiabank last month and I really regret it. I have had to contact them 5 times in one month for serious errors on their end. Today I received an email telling me my account (with >$10,000 in it) is in overdraft! So here I sit on the phone again. And every time I call I am met with a >45 minute wait time as ""they experience higher than unusual call volumes."" Something can't be called unusual when it's the norm. How stupid do they think their customers are?"
1998,Trust Pilot ,NA,Terrible customer care for credit cards. More than an hour on hold for unblocking my credit card. No avenue other than being on call. They don't even have a facility to call customer back. Should at least allow us to work with them in person at a bank branch. They don't have any issue taking the application for the cards at the branch. Awful.
1999,Trust Pilot ,NA,"I have been a Scotiabank customer for 24 years and was an employee for 10 years.  Over the years, I have seen their service decline, whether it's in branch, online or over the phone.  I am seriously reconsidering switching to some other bank!"
2000,Trust Pilot ,NA,Hands down the absolute worst customer service ive ever experienced. Constantly blocking my Legit e-transfers and expecting me to stay on the phone in 2 phases... Phase 1: Normal Customer Service Agent... 45 mins later after a series of security questions some of which are trick questions like what was the last transaction in account ending in 707...I dont have an account ending in 707. Then waiting as the operator tries to look into things for 15 mins more. Followed by transferring me to the Fraud dept where i again enter a Que for another 45 mins.. Where i am once again answered a series of security questions some of which are trick questions about cards I dont have. This is literally a monthly occurence.. I wont even get into what this is like if you are on holidays in a foreign country... Sometimes you even get a snarky Customer service REP... HORRENDOUS ... If you are considering Scotibank? DONT DO IT.. Even if they are the only ones offering you a loan. They are complete and utter garbage.
